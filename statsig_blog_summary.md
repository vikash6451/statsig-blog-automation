### 1. Profiling Server Core: How we cut memory usage by 85%

**Date:** 2025-10-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Daniel Loomb  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/profiling-server-core-how-we-cut-memory-usage


**Summary:**  
The goal was simple: optimize a single codebase and see the results across every server SDK. #### Server Core v0.2.0
When we first launched Server Core, we hadn't yet invested the time to improve memory.


**Key Points:**

- Our Legacy Statsig Python SDK at version 0.64.0

- Our Server Core Python SDK at version 0.2.0 (before memory optimizations)

- Our Server Core Python SDK at version 0.9.3 (latest optimizations)

- Strings consumed 56 MB.Repeated values like "idType": "userID" appeared thousands of times.

- Repeated values like "idType": "userID" appeared thousands of times.

- DynamicReturnable objects consumed 69 MB.They were often duplicated across experiments and layers.

- They were often duplicated across experiments and layers.

- Makes cloning cheap (critical for when the SDK logs exposures, where strings can be repeated frequently).

### 2. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong: Navigating multiple comparison corrections in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparison-corrections-in-a-b


**Summary:**  
This occurs when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted simultaneously, whether it’s peeking at the data during the experiment, examining several key performance indicators (KPIs), or analyzing different segments of the population. Example: For example, with an alpha of 5% and 5 tests, you would reject the null hypothesis for p-values lower than 0.01, instead of 0.05. Additionally, strict corrections like Bonferroni significantly reduce statistical power.


**Key Points:**

- Rank all p-values in ascending order.

- For each p-value, calculate 𝑖 / 𝑚 * 𝛼, where i is the rank of the p-value (according to step 1) and m is the total number of tests.

- Find the largest rank (k) for which the p-value is smaller than the value calculated in step 2.

- Reject all hypotheses till rank k.

- 1 control group, drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 12.

- 7 treatment groups, sampled from the same distribution as the control (i.e., no true effect).

- 3 treatment groups, each with a true revenue uplift of 2.5% (mean = 102.5).

- The proportion of significant results among the three treatment groups with true effects.

### 3. Experiments with AI in the Creative Process

**Date:** 2025-10-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cat Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experiments-with-ai-creative


**Summary:**  
In-house OOH campaigns are rare opportunities to exercise creativity beyond the usual brand tone. They can be tailored to their context - location, audience, event - and reframe a brand's core narrative. Example: (For example, uploading a picture of a pit stop wheel gun would generate something that looked like a hair dryer.)
Even after getting the generated image "close enough," the resolution was low, edges were messy, and details were off. Ultimately we found that using AI helped us increase ourcreative velocity: the speed at which our ideas could become real and move to execution.


**Key Points:**

- Quickly generate images to communicate concepts

- Create numerous copy variations to expand our brainstorms

- Research contextually relevant information

- Clarify your vision first—creative direction is keyThis is the pivotal point in the creative process where you either use AI creatively or let AI be creative for you.

- Use AI to optimize for AIOnce you've set a clear creative direction, refine your language to work with the specific image generation models you're using.

- Early Phase: Concept Development

- Mid Phase: Fleshing out a direction

- Key learnings for prompting

**Date:** 2025-10-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jessie Ong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/2-events-1-statsig


**Summary:**  
Behind the scenes of Statsig’s Austin Airport takeover. When two major events, the F1 Grand Prix and EXL 2025, landed back-to-back in Austin, we couldn’t ignore the opportunity. Example: ### Looking Back, and Ahead
What started as an airport ad buyout turned into a case study in creative agility and cross-functional collaboration. It was seeing how we could push our brand creatively in different directions while remaining true to our core: Statsig helps product builders move faster.


**Key Points:**

- Campaign 1: F1 speed meets product speed

- Campaign 2: A different type of precision

- Two Tones, One Brand

- Looking Back, and Ahead

- Example: ### Looking Back, and Ahead
What started as an airport ad buyout turned into a case study in creative agility and cross-functional collaboration.

- It was seeing how we could push our brand creatively in different directions while remaining true to our core: Statsig helps product builders move faster.

### 8. How we created count distinct in Statsig Cloud

**Date:** 2025-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Aamodit Acharya  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-we-created-count-distinct-in-statsig-cloud


**Summary:**  
When I joined Statsig, I spent my first week reading through customer requests. Almost immediately, a pattern jumped out to me. Unique artists in the first 7 days.


**Key Points:**

- Distinct artists listened per user

- Distinct SKUs purchased per user

- Distinct search queries issued per user

- Distinct repositories pushed per user

- Distinct merchants paid per user

- Wed: viewed {A}If you summed daily distincts you would get 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.Merging the three sketches yields {A, B, C}, which is 3.

- I kept the core model in Spark SQL and stored each day’s sketch as a base64 string in Parquet on GCS so it can safely move through BigQuery tables when needed.

- On the Spark side, I decode that field back into a native sketch and continue merges and extraction with the Spark UDFs and helpers.

### 9. Sink, swim, or scale: What startups teach us about launching AI

**Date:** 2025-08-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Alexey Komissarouk  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-startups-lessons-learned


**Summary:**  
About the guest author.Alexey Komissarouk is aGrowth Engineering Advisorwho teachesGrowth Engineering on Reforge. Previously, he was the Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Early users, however, complained they “still didn’t know what to do with this thing.”Notion pivotedfrom “AI writes for you” to “AI improves what you’ve already written,” redesigned starter prompts, and saw usage rise as the mental cost of exploration dropped.


**Key Points:**

- Pre‑negotiate burst capacity with vendors (spot GPUs, secondary clouds, reseller credits) so you scale up within minutes without surprise bills.

- Offer a “happy hour” off‑peak tier that absorbs hobby traffic without harming premium latency.

- Replace blank prompt boxes with role‑based starter chips and one‑click examples that autofill.

- Instrument “prompt redo” and “undo” events as frustration signals; run weekly funnel reviews on them.

- Offer an “explain my last prompt” toggle—turning trial‑and‑error into guided learning.

- When financially viable, start with a flat plan that eliminates mental transaction costs; layer in usage-based overages only once users reach actual ceilings.

- Expose “token burn so far” inside the interface, not tucked away in billing dashboards.

- Run price‑sensitivity experiments onengagedcohorts, not top‑of‑funnel sign‑ups; willingness to pay lags perceived mastery.

### 10. Optimizing cloud compute costs with GKE and compute classes

**Date:** 2025-07-25T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-cloud-compute-costs-with-gke-and-compute-classes


**Summary:**  
Anyone who has optimized cloud compute costs knows that spot nodes can significantly reduce your bill. Example: But we found that node weighting alone has significant limitations:
- Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling
Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling
- Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time
Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time
### Detailed real-world example
To showcase why this is problematic here is a detailed example. ### How do you reduce your cloud compute costs without using a third-party vendor?


**Key Points:**

- Loss of Control: You're entrusting third-party providers with your node management, which could risk disrupting your workflows with opaque algorithms

- Cost: These services can significantly add to your operational expenses

- Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling

- Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time

- Pool A: Cheapest spot nodes, high preemption rate (5% per hour)

- Pool B: Moderately priced spot nodes, lower preemption rate (2% per hour)

- Pool C: Non-spot nodes, most expensive, zero preemption

- Initial State: All workloads run on Pool A (100 nodes).

### 12. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. Example: Another great example is Notion AI, which writes and summarizes within your existing workspace. Keep response time below 200 ms and uptime above 99.9 %, and you’ve passed.


**Key Points:**

- Google's Geminioutperformed GPT-4 on 30 of 32 benchmarksand beat humans on language understanding tests. Once deployed, it suggestedadding glue to pizzato make cheese stick better.

- Perplexity faced lawsuitsforcreating fake news sectionsand falsely attributing content to real publications.

- Note: We recently launched our Evals product that solves this problem - clickhereto learn more

- Monitor success metrics.These metrics become your real quality benchmarks. The easiest way to do this is with product analytics.

- Watch user sessions.Record user interactions to understand the stories behind metrics - why users drop off, where confusion occurs, when they ignore AI suggestions.

- Ship big changes as A/B tests.Do 50/50 rollouts of what you think will be big wins to quantify the impact. This helps your team build intuition for what actually moves the needle.

- Expand.Ship features to larger and larger groups of users, monitoring success metrics and bad outcomes as you go.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

### 13. The more the merrier? The problem of multiple comparisons in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-07-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results? Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

- How to deal with multiple comparisons

- Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.

### 14. Randomization: The ABC’s of A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-06-30T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it? Example: This example underscores the critical importance of random allocation. It may also be influenced by infrastructure constraints (e.g., if the company’s allocation system only supports online assignment) or performance considerations (e.g., offline assignment may reduce runtimes).


**Key Points:**

- (A) Simple Randomization:Randomly assign users into two groups without considering balancing factors.

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

- Simple randomization: just go with the flow

- Seed randomization: Take your best shot

- Stratified randomization: Be a control freak

- ‍Which randomization method should you use?

- 1. Which users are participating in the experiment?

### 15. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift.


**Key Points:**

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

- It is less susceptible to external shocks (holidays, marketing pulses).

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- Use proxies, not your KPIs

- Boost signal and reduce noise with thoughtful statistics

- Covariate adjustment (CUPED & CURE)

### 16. You can have it all: Parallel testing with A/B tests

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel. By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.


**Key Points:**

- Why test in parallel?

- What should you watch out for?

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel.

- By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.

### 17. Move forward: The A/B testing mindset guide

**Date:** 2025-06-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Israel Ben Baruch  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/move-forward-the-a-b-testing-mindset-guide


**Summary:**  
Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time. It sharpens your thinking and helps you act faster if your current test fails.


**Key Points:**

- Be obsessed.You check results more than you should. You run through your funnels again and again. Your head swarms with ideas. You’re not crazy, you’re exactly where you should be.

- Organizational culture.Your mindset needs an organization that supports it - one that encourages people to take risks, experiment, and always push forward.

- Professional expertise.CRO is a craft. Find the people, the content, and the companies to learn from. Apply. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. Most importantly: keep evolving.

- Great tools.Use high-quality, reliable measurement and testing platforms. They’re the foundation of effective testing. No compromises.

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

### 18. Experimentation and AI: 4 trends we’re seeing 

**Date:** 2025-06-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. Example: Example: It has become common for chat interface-based apps (like ChatGPT, Vercel V0, Lovable) to experiment with suggested prompts to help users quickly discover and realize value, which subsequently drives engagement and retention.


**Key Points:**

- Good logging on all the product metrics you care about

- The ability to link these metrics to everything you release

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

- Trend 2: More AI code drives the need for quantitative optimization

- Trend 3: Every engineer is a growth engineer

- Trend 4: Product value comes from your unique context

- Closing thoughts: AI is part of every product

### 19. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. Example: For example, if you were a developer seeing this code, it felt like choosing between the black wire and the red wire to cut if you had a time bomb in front of you:
There was even one time when someone accidentally set production services to connect to ourlatest(dev-stage) Redis instance instead of the correct prod one. It was time to build a tool that would help us move faster and safer.


**Key Points:**

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

- First, a developer pushes changes to a repo (call it Service X).

- Automated regional rollouts, powered by StatsigRelease Pipelines

- Shadow pipeline simulations

- Cost-based VM selection automation

- Highly manual configuration

- Disconnected dependencies

### 20. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. Example: For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes.


**Key Points:**

- the number of units in the control group is relatively small, and

- the denominator is relatively noisy (but still statistically distinct from 0)

- \( Z_{\alpha/2} \) is the critical value associated with the desired confidence level

- \( \mathrm{var}(X_C) \) is the variance of the control group metric values

- \( n_C \) is the number of units in the control group

- \( \overline{X_C} \) is the mean of the control group metric values

### 21. Why data and intuition aren&#39;t enemies

**Date:** 2025-05-30T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Laurel Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-data-and-intuition-arent-enemies


**Summary:**  
I’ve always been excited by the power of data storytelling. Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example. Metrics are often consulted only when something breaks, not when there is an opportunity to improve.


**Key Points:**

- Great products come from intuition guided by data, not intuition versus data.

- The uphill battle for metrics adoption

- Reframing the relationship between data and intuition

- The adaptive nature of good metrics

- Moving forward with adaptive taste

- Finding a data-informed culture at Statsig

- Product manager playbook

- Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example.

### 22. Empowering your team is the future of product leadership

**Date:** 2025-05-28T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. Paradoxically,trying to control everything actually reduces your control over what matters most.


**Key Points:**

- Defining outcomes that matter rather than dictating every task

- Providing context about user needs and business priorities

- Creating frameworks that enable autonomous decision-making

- Trusting your engineers to determine the "how" once they understand the "why"

- The challenge of proving value

- The two paths for product leaders

- The brute force PM

- The force-multiplier leader

### 23. Simulating Bigtable in BigQuery with Type 2 SCD modeling

**Date:** 2025-05-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Example: For example, “How does user behavior on our app change before, during, and after they obtain a premium subscription?”
We also need to store these updates in aversioned mannersince customers often want to observe how user behavior changes over time or with different properties. Bigtable’s write path also comfortably sustains millions of QPS, so cross‑region replication keeps read latency below 10 ms no matter wherever the request originates, letting us replicate it in near real-time.


**Key Points:**

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- User-property updates are generated in one of two ways (in blue). Customers either set up bulk uploads in our web console, or they use our SDKS to log them at run-time.

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

- Then, we have a Dataflow that reads those updates from Bigtable CDC, and streams those to BigQuery in near real-time.

- The current state of the Bigtable:

- The state of the Bigtable at some moment in time:

- How some property has changed over time:

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

### 24. Chasing metrics, not tasks: Why outcome-obsessed PMs win

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. One of my focus areas was improving our customer acquisition funnel.


**Key Points:**

- Misaligned incentives:Measuring success by task completion rather than outcome impact reinforced a culture of checking boxes rather than driving real business results.

- Letting go of sunk costs:When the data shows an initiative isn’t working, cut it – no matter how much time you’ve invested.

- Zooming out regularly:That metric you’ve been optimizing might not be the one that matters most. Don’t miss the forest for the trees.

- My metrics-focused foundation

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- The roadmap is a false comfort

- The buy-in breakthrough

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 25. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- How do you interpret the outcome of a non-inferiority test?

- How do you properly integrate non-inferiority tests into your company's A/B testing process?

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

### 26. Fail faster, learn faster: Why &#34;done&#34; beats &#34;perfect&#34; in modern product management

**Date:** 2025-05-20T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. Shipping thin slices lets you take more at-bats, improve your swing, and learn from each attempt.


**Key Points:**

- Create feedback loops to build learnings from users quickly

- Limit the potential downsides if a feature underperforms and course correct

- Build stakeholder confidence by showing visible progress

- Collect real-world feedback that no amount of planning can substitute for

- Build organizational muscle memory for rapid learning

- Create space for high-risk, high-reward ideas that might be killed in a "perfect first time" culture

- Free up resources to pursue more opportunities rather than polishing a single feature

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

### 27. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. Example: For example, let’s say you true north metric is the revenue generated in the next year. Over time, product changes can improve or degrade the quality of prediction that a particular surrogate model produces.


**Key Points:**

- Inputs should be independent of assignment. Assignment to any given experiment group should be random and not correlated to any input to the predictive model.

- Outputs should not exhibit heteroscedasticity. For each predicted value, the prediction and the expected magnitude of the error term should not be correlated.

Howie Xu, Chief AI & Innovation Officer at Gen, founder of VMware’s networking division, and AI-focused investor and lecturer at Stanford
From the slow burn of AI adoption to the messy realities of product growth, the conversation was rich with honest takes, timeless lessons, and the kind of hard-won wisdom you only get from people who’ve shipped at scale.


**Key Points:**

- Ami Vora, former CPO of Faire and VP of Product at WhatsApp and Facebook Ads

- Rajeev Rajan, CTO at Atlassian and former VP of Engineering at Facebook and Microsoft

- Howie Xu, Chief AI & Innovation Officer at Gen, founder of VMware’s networking division, and AI-focused investor and lecturer at Stanford

- Ami: At WhatsApp, the focus was on reliability and making the product feel like a utility or physical object. Fewer tests, fewer changes, and a relentless commitment to stability.

- Rajeev: Atlassian steers clear of sweeping UI overhauls in Jira. “It’s like redesigning a car dashboard—you can’t mess with muscle memory.”

- Ami: “Stay on the frontier of learning. It never feels good to be bad at something—but that’s where the learning starts.”

- Rajeev: “Forget the next title. Write the book of your life—what story do you want to tell?”

- Howie: “The new skill is TQ—token quotient. The more you engage with AI tools, the more prepared you’ll be.”

### 31. Continuous promotion for infrastructure with Statsig and Pulumi

**Date:** 2025-04-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics.


**Key Points:**

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

- Deployments that must be paused for manual sign‑off orchange‑management windows

- Initialize the Statsig server SDK at the start of your deployment.

- Get deployment decision from feature flags or dynamic configs.

- Deploy the target resources.

- Approve:Manually green‑light the next phase once metrics look good.

- Pause:Hold the rollout at the current phase to gather more data or schedule windows.

### 32. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. But when CVR improves while retention craters, the illusion breaks.


**Key Points:**

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

- Hidden cost of partial coverage:blind spots compound. Teams over‑index on the few things they do measure, and leadership starts believing an incomplete trend line.

- Integrate feature flags and experiments so every featurecanbe a testby default.

- Align engineering KPIs with metrics impact, not feature launch.

- Sunset legacy code that cannot be instrumented; it taxes every future decision.

- Why enterprises struggle:each domain team owns a slice of data; merging them requires cross‑org agreements and latency‑tolerant pipelines.

- Metrics is the language of the company. Make them clear and transparent with a centralized catalog.

- For experiments, pick a couple of primary metrics and a few guardrail metrics. Try to standardize across similar experiments.

### 33. Release pipelines: Safer, staged rollouts across your infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-04-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/release-pipelines


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we believe you can move fastwithoutbreaking things. Your 1% of users could be distributed across hundreds of clusters, and if this change causes unexpected behavior in production, it could bring down your entire infrastructure stack, as every server experiences the increased CPU and memory usage.


**Key Points:**

- Roll out changes environment by environment (dev → staging → prod)

- Target specific infrastructure segments within environments (prod-us-west → prod-us-east → prod-eu)

- Control progression between stages with time intervals or manual approvals

- Monitor each stage before proceeding to the next

- Roll back instantly if issues arise at any stage

- Catch issues early, before they affect a large portion of your infrastructure

- Prevent cascading failuresacross your entire system, ensuring higher uptime

- Validate changes in real production environmentswith minimal risk

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Example: Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:
Figure 3:A P95 performance graph comparing our legacy Node SDK (green) and Node Core SDK (blue) runtime for a gate check. With Rust's memory safety, performance, concurrency, and zero-cost abstractions, the improvements to actual evaluation time have been huge enough to outweigh the binding costs.


**Key Points:**

- pyo3 (Python):Getting started - PyO3 user guide

- napi-rs (Node):Getting started – NAPI-RS

- jni-rs (Java):GitHub - jni-rs/jni-rs: Rust bindings to the Java Native Interface

- ruslter (Elixir):GitHub - rusterlium/rustler: Safe Rust bridge for creating Erlang NIF functions

- What we learned

- Join the Slack community

### 35. The rise of experimentation as the industry standard

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. Example: One notable example is the16-month TV advertising experimentAmazon ran in a few markets, which showed that TV ads delivered only a modest sales bump. In the new model we grow bylearning faster—hundreds of tiny, controlled bets that compound.


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- Experimenting with the length of forms to mitigate user dropoffs

- Using 20% of an email audience to suss out the best email subject line and sending it to the remaining 80%

- Testingvirtually anythingin a focus group

- Implementing customer surveys to gauge reactions to potential upcoming initiatives

- Jeff Bezos on the importance of experimentation

### 36. Digital marketing attribution models: A tech survey

**Date:** 2025-04-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. Example: Early versions were still rule-based (for example, splitting credit evenly or favoring the first and last touches). MMM emerged in the 1950s (though it rose to popularity in the 1980s) as a top-down approach that uses aggregate data and statistical regression to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel to sales [1].


**Key Points:**

- Shapley Value Attribution

- Algorithmic/Statistical Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ML)

- Incrementality Testing and Lift Models

- Causal Inference-Based Multi-Channel Attribution

- Customer Journey-based Deep Learning Models

- Captures sequential nature of journeys.

- Explains results via the “If we remove channel X, how many conversions are lost?” logic, which is intuitive.

- More nuanced than any single-position rule; channels that primarily appear in converting paths get more credit.

### 38. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Example: For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:
On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of. We also have tools likeCUPEDthat will control for values that we can see before the experiment, avoiding the worst of the bias and making your experiments run faster.


**Key Points:**

- You have to choose experiments that can be applied across pages, and that you'd expect to have a similar impact on each of the pages you'd apply it to.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

- Image optimizations,such as enabling lazy loading across all pages.

- Multimedia enhancements,like adding audio versions of blog posts to see if this boosts engagement or traffic.

- Challenges of SEO A/B testing

- Designing your experiment

### 39. How to accurately test statistical significance

**Date:** 2025-04-12T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/steps-to-accurately-test-statistical-significance


**Summary:**  
This is where the concept of statistical significance comes into play, helping you make confident choices based on solid data. Example: For example, when testing if a new feature increases user engagement, the null hypothesis would be that engagement remains unchanged. For example, when testing if a new feature increases user engagement, the null hypothesis would be that engagement remains unchanged.


**Key Points:**

- Avoid making decisions based on false positives or random noise

- Identify genuine patterns and relationships that can inform strategic choices

- Allocate resources and investments towards initiatives with proven impact

- Minimize the risk of costly mistakes or missed opportunities

- Clearly define your null and alternative hypotheses based on the question you're investigating

- Select an α that balances the risks ofType I and Type II errorsfor your specific context

- Ensure your sample size is adequate to detect meaningful differences at your chosen α

- A p-value does not indicate the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false. It only measures the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis were true.

### 40. Why A/B testing is ultimately qualitative

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-ab-testing-is-ultimately-qualitative


**Summary:**  
People with diverse perspectives have to debate options in a room, weighing pros and cons between multiple (sometimes conflicting) objectives, many of which can't be captured in a single metric.


**Key Points:**

- Start with a purpose: Don’t run experiments without a well-considered hypothesis. Don't just think aboutwhatmetrics will move, think aboutwhythey might move.

- Invite broader feedback: Listen to stakeholders who might have non-quantitative insights. They may spot factors that algorithms or dashboards might miss.

- Frame decisions as trade-offs: A/B tests often reveal gains in one metric at the expense of another. Bring in qualitative judgments about which trade-offs matter most.

- Understanding the bigger picture

- The limitations of data and the role of expert judgment

- A balanced approach: Numbers and narrative

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

### 41. Introducing CURE: Smarter regression, faster experiments

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/announcing-cure


**Summary:**  
Statsig is excited to announce that we’re moving out of beta testing and into full production launch for CURE - an extension of CUPED - which allows users to add arbitrary covariate data to regression adjustment in their experiments, reducing variance even further than existing CUPED implementations. Example: For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results. For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED: Controlled [Experiment] Using Pre-Experiment Data

- CURE: [Variance] Control Using Regression Estimates

- If you have a predictive model of future behaviors, you can easilyuse that as a covariate in CURE(like Doordash’s CUPAC)

- If you want to provide additional signal to the standard CUPAC approach, you canpick and choose different user attributes or behaviorsto add to the regression

- CURE brings powerful, flexible regression adjustment to every Statsig experiment.

### 46. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. Example: For example, a treatment’s impact on revenue might be most noticeable among high-spending players, where behavioral changes are more pronounced. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects.


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type II error (β):The probability of failing to detect a true improvement when one exists.

- Set the winsorization threshold (X%):In A/B testing, common choices are 1% or 0.1%, depending on the required adjustment and sample size.

- Replace extreme values:Values beyond these thresholds are capped at the corresponding percentile values.

- Why outliers can be harmful

- How to identify outliers

- What to do with outliers

- Time for winsorization!

### 48. Designing controlled experiments to test correlated metrics

**Date:** 2025-03-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/designing-controlled-experiments-correlated-metrics


**Summary:**  
Correlationoccurs when there is a relationship between the values of some variable with the values of some other bariable. total spend in the first 7 days a user is active may be predictive of total spend in the following 6 months
Surrogate metrics, metrics that are a leading indicator or another metric - e.g.


**Key Points:**

- Metric families, metrics that measure the same/similar phenomena - e.g. a total spend per user, total revenue per buyer, and a 0/1 indicator for purchasing

- What are correlated metrics?

- Correlated metrics in an experiment

- Metric families

- Surrogate metrics

- Intrinsic metrics

- Independence assumptions in multiple comparison corrections

- total spend in the first 7 days a user is active may be predictive of total spend in the following 6 months

### 49. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Example: For example, if you’re trying out a new shipping policy, you can apply it in one state while leaving a similar region as control. ### 3.Phased Rollouts
A phased rollout gradually increases the share of users or clusters that see a new feature (e.g., 1% to 10% to 50%), always using random assignment at each step.


**Key Points:**

- Ensure consistent assignment: If you want a single user to see the same variant as both a buyer and a seller, factor that into your randomization logic.

### 50. What no one tells you about feature flags and messy code

**Date:** 2025-03-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others. Example: Let's walk through an example. For example, if the flag is being used to slowly roll out a new checkout experience, and you're aiming for 100% rollout by the end of the month, create a “Removeff_new_checkout” ticket with a due date 30–45 days after full rollout.


**Key Points:**

- [ ] Remove all `if/else` conditions using `ff_new_checkout`

- [ ] Delete the flag from Statsig’s dashboard (mark as deprecated first)

- [ ] Remove related experiment code or tracking if applicable

- [ ] Update documentation or `FLAGS.md` if needed

- [ ] Confirmation that no users are on the legacy flow

- [ ] No recent rollbacks in the past 14 days

- When should this flag be removed?

- Who’s responsible for removing it?

**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. - Tightening the Confidence (Credible) Interval:Alternatively, one can choose a narrower prior that reduces uncertainty in the posterior distribution.


**Key Points:**

- The choice of priors can strongly influence the resulting posterior estimates, requiring careful calibration to avoid unintentionally skewing the analysis.

- Neither type of informed Bayesian approach is “wrong” in principle, but the first introduces a greater risk of data manipulation, while the second can slow down decision-making.

- In many cases, the second approach is effectively equivalent to applying FDR-type frequentist adjustments and often yields the same outcomes, just framed in Bayesian terms.

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

### 53. Why buying an experimentation platform makes more sense than building one

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/buying-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
“Building your own experimentation platform made a lot of sense… five years ago,” says our customer Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager - Core ML at Whatnot, who previously worked on DoorDash’s in-house platform. Example: For example, over the past year we’ve shipped several advanced capabilities that you won’t find in a typical experimentation platform:
- Stats methodologies such as stratified sampling, differential impact detection, interaction detection, Benjamini Hochberg procedure etc. Over the past few years, several companies have moved away from in-house experimentation tooling and turned to Statsig to scale their experimentation cultures.Notionincreased their experimentation velocity by 30x within a year.Limewent from limited testing to experimenting on every change before rolling it out.


**Key Points:**

- Server & client-side SDKsfor seamless experimentation across all surfaces without impacting performance

- Data logging, ingestion and processing servicesand/or integration with your data warehouse

- Randomization functionsfor accurate user allocations in different scenarios

- Experiment result computationsincluding metric lifts, p-values, confidence intervals, and other statistical calculations

- Automated checks(like power analysis, balanced exposures) to ensure experiments are properly set up and issues are identified proactively

- Statistical correctionsto account for outliers, pre-experimental bias, and differential impact, etc. to provide trustworthy results

- Variance reduction(CUPED, winsorization)

- Experimentation techniqueslike sequential testing, switchback testing, geo-based tests etc.

**Date:** 2025-03-06T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/automating-bigquery-load-jobs-gcs


**Summary:**  
As our data needs evolved, we created a flexible and dynamic ingestion solution. Example: Example:
## Orchestrating workflows
We use an orchestrator configured to trigger our Python ingestion script periodically, following a cron-like schedule. Time-based bucketing of files
We organize incoming data into discrete time buckets (e.g., every 1,000 seconds).


**Key Points:**

- Automatically detect and ingest data into new tables dynamically.

- Group files into time-based buckets for organized ingestion.

- Reliably track ingestion jobs, accounting for potential delays in status reporting.

- BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS:for historical job statuses and to identify completed or failed jobs.

- MongoDB:for tracking pending and initiated jobs to mitigate delays in BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA updates.

- bq_load_source_bucket_name: Indicates the originating bucket for the load job.

- bq_load_dest_table_name: Indicates the destination table for the load job.

- bq_load_bucket_timestamp: Indicates the specific time bucket processed.

### 56. KPI traps: How &#34;successful&#34; experiments can still be failures

**Date:** 2025-03-05T00:02-08:00  
**Author:** Lin Jia  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kpi-traps-successful-experiments-can-fail


**Summary:**  
You set up the experiment cautiously, collected data diligently, and celebrated when it achieved statistical significance for your KPI. Example: For example, a company notices that customer service calls are taking too long. When they run a two-week experiment to measure the impact, they find that DAU increases as more users return to the app.


**Key Points:**

- Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever.

- Success on paper, but failure in practice

- False positive risk

- False positive risk given the success rate, p-value threshold of 0.025 (successes only), and 80% power

- How to avoid KPI traps

- Align KPIs with business goals

- Use multiple metrics including high-level objective, user behaviors, and guardrails

- Monitor long-term effects for shipped experiments

### 60. Beyond prompts: A data-driven approach to LLM optimization

**Date:** 2025-03-04T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Anna Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/llm-optimization-online-experimentation


**Summary:**  
This article presents a systematic framework for online A/B testing of LLM applications, focusing onprompt engineering, model selection, and temperature tuning. Example: ## Experiment design and statistical rigor
### Hypothesis and goal
Define a measurable hypothesis: e.g., “Adding an example to the prompt will increase correct answer rates by 5%.” This clarity guides your metrics and success criteria. By isolating and experimenting with specific factors, teams can generate tangible improvements in performance, user engagement, and cost-efficiency.


**Key Points:**

- Improve performance: Validate hypothesis-driven changes (like new prompts) directly with real users.

- Reduce costs: Pinpoint “good enough” model variants or narrower context windows that maintain quality while lowering expenses.

- Boost engagement: Track user behaviors such as conversation length, retention, or click-through rates to ensure AI experiences resonate with users.

- Randomized user allocation: Users are split—often 50/50—so each group experiences only one variant. Randomization ensures a fair comparison.

- Single variable isolation: If testing a new prompt, keep the model and temperature consistent across both variants to attribute outcome differences to prompt changes.

- A different base model (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5).

- A refined prompt with new instructions or examples.

- Altered parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p).

### 61. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Vercel Native Integration

**Date:** 2025-02-27T07:00-12:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-vercel-native-integration


**Summary:**  
Modern web development depends on a seamless experience for users and developers. Performant, fast, and reliable websites are table stakes for users in 2025.At the same time, websites and applications are becoming increasingly complex, with more features, integrations, and components contributing to the user experience. Example: For example, if you're introducing a new navigation layout, you can first enable the flag for internal users, gather feedback, and then gradually roll it out to production—all without pushing a new deployment. No developer wants to manage extra configurations, third-party dashboards, or custom integrations, and no user wants to see a page flicker on load, or experience another 100ms wait until the page renders.


**Key Points:**

- Create and manage feature flagsto control your releases

- Run experimentsto test changes and measure impact

- Gain access to Analytics, Session Replay, and other Statsig product toolsthat don’t exist natively in your Vercel dashboard

- Use Statsig’s SDKs and Edge Config syncingfor low-latency performance without additional setup

- Install the integration:Find Statsig in the Vercel Marketplace and complete the quick setup flow

- Choose a billing plan:Both plans offer generous limits: theFree tierincludes 2M events/month, while thePro tierprovides 5M events/month for just $150

- Install Statsig and connect your Statsig project: Link your Statsig project to Vercel to sync feature flags, experiments, settings, permissions, etc.

- Initialize with Vercel’s Flags SDK or Statsig's SDK:We recommend using Vercel's Flags SDK for Next.js and SvelteKit projects; use Statsig’s SDK for all other projects

### 62. How to think about the relationship between correlation and causation

**Date:** 2025-02-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/correlation-vs-causation-guide


**Summary:**  
Yet, people still confuse correlation with causation all the time. Example: For example, this upsell that claims “4x” profile views as promised by LinkedIn Premium is definitely more correlation than causation. The trouble starts when people try to lock down a specific metric or target, like the famous claim thatadding more than 10 friends in 7 days is the key to Facebook’s engagement.


**Key Points:**

- Spot most cases of confusionbetween correlation and causation and form a clear idea of where the errors might come from.

- Grasp the essence of causal inference modelsbased on observed data. You’ll see exactly when their assumptions hold and when they don’t.

- Fifteen-year-old children who took the pill grew an average of 3 inches in one year.

- In the same schools, fifteen-year-old children who didnottake the pill grew an average of 2 inches in one year.

- Families with more money can afford the pill and give their kids better nutrition.

- Families who choose the pill care more about healthy growth and use other measures.

- Families who opt for the pill have shorter kids to begin with, so they show more “catch-up” growth.

- Most of us have heard the phrase “correlation isn’t causation.”

### 64. What are guardrail metrics in A/B tests?

**Date:** 2025-02-26T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Michael Makris  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-are-guardrail-metrics-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Your team designed the feature well, you set ambitious business targets, you built the feature well, and designed a solid A/B test to measure the results. Example: For example, if you're testing a new user interface, your primary metric might be the click-through rate on a feature button. While you aim to improve specific aspects of your product through A/B testing, you shouldn’t compromise on the overall system and business health.


**Key Points:**

- Ensuring that gains in one area do not cause losses in another

- Providing a holistic view of the impact of your tests

- Interactions with other features

- Envision the following:

- Introduction to guardrail metrics in A/B testing

### 65. How Statsig uses query-level experiments to speed up Metrics Explorer

**Date:** 2025-02-20T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Nicole Smith  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/query-level-experiments-metrics-explorer


**Summary:**  
Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. However, when we’re making performance improvements to Metrics Explorer queries, we’re less concerned with a stable user experience for experimentation purposes, and more concerned with making them faster in every scenario.


**Key Points:**

- More funnel steps: When there are more funnel steps, the size of the temp table or CTE in question is more likely to be larger.

- Grouping by a field: This tends to make subsequent steps in the query more expensive, so having using a temp table may be more efficient when a group by is in place.

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

- The implementation

- Handling assignment

- Query event telemetry

**Author:** Pushpendra Nagtode  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/balancing-scale-cost-performance-experimentation-systems


**Summary:**  
Costs can rise quickly due to the merging of user metrics and exposure logging, a critical yet expensive step in A/B testing. This paper presents key observations in designing an elastic and efficient experimentation system (EEES):
- Cost: An analysis of major cost components and effective strategies to reduce costs.


**Key Points:**

- Cost: An analysis of major cost components and effective strategies to reduce costs.

- Design: Separation of metric definitions from logging to maintain log integrity and enable end-to-end data traceability.

- Technologies: Our transition from Databricks to Google BigQuery and in-house solutions, including motivations and trade-offs.

- Streaming platform: This platform ingests raw exposures and events, ensuring all incoming data is captured in real-time and stored in a raw data layer for further processing.

- Imports: When users have events stored in their own data warehouses, pipelines import this data into the raw data layer, creating a unified data source.

- A/B testing is easy to start but challenging to scale without a well-designed data platform.

### 68. Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics: Not a big deal?

**Date:** 2025-02-11T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-vs-frequentist-statistics


**Summary:**  
One common area of confusion and heated debate is the difference betweenBayesian and Frequentist approaches. In theory, they offer several advantages:
- Faster, more accurate decision-making
Faster, more accurate decision-making
- The ability to leverage past information
The ability to leverage past information
- A structured way to debate underlying assumptions
A structured way to debate underlying assumptions
Because of these benefits, some advocate for their adoption including data scientists at companies like Amazon and Netflix (ref).


**Key Points:**

- The unknown is fixed:Thetrueaverage height of adults in your city isn't changing while you're analyzing your data. It's a fixed, albeit unknown, number.

- Randomness is in the data:The randomness comes fromwhichpeople you happen to sample. If you repeated your survey many times, you'd get slightly different results each time.

- Frequentists:Focus on the long-run frequency of events. Probability is about how often something would happen if you repeated the experiment many times.

- Bayesians:Focus on the degree of belief or certainty about an unknown. Probability is a measure of how likely something is, given your current knowledge.

- Large samples:When you have a lot of data, Bayesian and Frequentist approaches tend to give very similar results. The data overwhelms any prior beliefs in the Bayesian approach.

- A Frequentist might see if a 95% confidence interval for the difference in conversion rates excludes zero.

- A Bayesian might see if a 95% credible interval for the difference lies entirely above zero.

- In most cases, they'll reach the same conclusion about which version is better.

### 77. Settings 2.0: Keeping up with a scaling product

**Date:** 2025-01-29T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Cynthia Xin  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/settings-page-design-2025


**Summary:**  
Over the past few years, Statsig has scaled significantly, adding multiple products and features to our platform. Example: In Settings 1.0, the left-side navigation menu was essentially broken down into "project" and "organization."
If users wanted to edit settings for a feature gate, for example, they needed to remember which settings were considered project settings versus organization settings, often resulting in users having to navigate different tabs just to track down one toggle. ### UI simplification
We updated the UI in Settings 2.0 to improve usability while adhering toour latest design system, Pluto.


**Key Points:**

- Members > Select a Team > Edit Team Settings

### 78. Stratified sampling in A/B Tests

**Date:** 2025-01-28T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/stratified-sampling-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Stratified sampling might just be the tool you need to bring clarity and precision to yourA/B testing efforts. Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison. This approach not only improves the quality of your data but also deepens your understanding of how different segments interact with your product.


**Key Points:**

- Identify key covariates: Look at past data to see which demographics or behaviors link closely with the changes you’re testing.

- Categorize your users: Group them by these identified covariates. This ensures each category is tested.

- Imagine you're running experiments to fine-tune your product, but your results swing wildly in every experiment you run.

### 79. The ultimate guide to building an internal feature flagging system

**Date:** 2025-01-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
“Why do people pay for this?”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions. Example: You’re also likely to find some synergies in the code you write across these two services - for example, the service that provides evaluated flag values to clients can borrow logic from the code that evaluates rulesets on your servers, provided they’re written in the same language. - Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?


**Key Points:**

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

- Handle targeting on any user trait, like app version, country, IP address, etc.?

- Have extremely high uptime?

- test a feature in production (by “gating” it to only employees/ beta testers)

- rollout a feature to only certain geographies (by “gating” on user countries)

- run an A/B test (by gating a feature to a random 50% of userIDs)

- Or Run acanary release(release a feature to a random 10% of userIDs, to check that it doesn’t break anything)

### 80. Understanding (and reducing) variance and standard deviation

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:01-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-and-reducing-variance-and-standard-deviation


**Summary:**  
But uncertainty is an inevitability, and it's useful to be able to quantify it. Example: For example, if the standard deviation in our a/b test was close to infinity,anyobservation would be reasonably likely to occur by chance . - If we take a population of 10000 users, split them into even groups, and give half a treatment and half a placebo, we can use standard deviation to evaluate if the treatment did anything.


**Key Points:**

- Assume there is no treatment effect

- Measure our outcome metric

- Calculate the standard deviations of the populations’ metric, and the difference in mean metric values between the two groups

- Calculate the probability of observing that difference in means, given the standard deviation/spread of the population metric

- Variance is the average of squared differences from the mean. For each observation, we subtract the mean, multiply the result by itself, and then add all of those values up

- Standard deviation is the square root of the variance in the population

- Standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of observations

- Variance and standard deviation (MIT lecture)

### 81. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. Example: For example, if most control exposures come from the US while the test group is evenly split between EU and US, the issue might be linked to the SDK in the EU release. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users.


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Why it’s important

- Our new debugging capabilities

- Get started now!

### 82. Detecting interaction effects of concurrent experiments

**Date:** 2025-01-13T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Kane Luo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/interaction-effect-detection


**Summary:**  
To accelerate experimentation, medium to large companies run hundreds of A/B tests simultaneously, aiming to isolate and measure the impact of each change, also known as the "main effect."
However, when multiple tests target the same area of your product, they can influence one another, resulting in either overestimation or underestimation of metric changes. Example: For example, to understand the effect of dark mode without the transition animation, you would compare group C to group A using a standard two-sample t-test. This expands the UI compatibility and aims to improve retention.


**Key Points:**

- Relaunch the same experimentsto a mutually exclusive audience. This is especially useful if you need more statistical power particularly on secondary metrics.

- Conduct manual statistical testsand determine which one of the two features to ship.

- If the interaction is synergistic, you candouble down on the combined experience, by either launching a new test or analyzing group A and D.

- Rework the experienceto make the feature compatible.

- Statsig now offersinteraction effect detectionto uncover the hidden effects of experiments on each other.

- Scenario: Dark mode gone wrong

- How do we diagnose it?

- My experiments are interacting—now what?

### 84. How to report test results

**Date:** 2025-01-02T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-report-test-results


**Summary:**  
Now comes the critical moment—communicating your insights to your company’s stakeholders. Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups. Analysts may prematurely generalize sample results to the population, leading to overly definitive claims such as, “This feature will increase revenue by 10%” or “The conversion rate in the new version improved by 5%.”
How to get it right: When communicating test results, it’s crucial to remember that your data reflects what happens in your sample and may not precisely represent the population.


**Key Points:**

- Secondary KPIs: For secondary KPIs, summarize the results visually or in a table that includes the uplift, the boundaries of the confidence interval, and the p-value.

- 1. Overstating certainty

- 2. Confusing Test Settings with Test Results

- 3. Misinterpreting p-values

- 4. Misinterpreting confidence interval

- 5. Ignoring external validity

- An example: Report of test’s results

- Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups.

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/key-problems-in-d2c-that-experimentation-solves


**Summary:**  
“Half your ideas will fail… you need to verify and tweak your ideas until they actually deliver value for the customer.”
– Wyatt Thompson, Dollar Shave Club
## Why D2C brands face unique challenges
Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands thrive by forging direct relationships with customers—yet this also makes them vulnerable to every friction point along the user journey. Example: For example, small tweaks to the timing or format of promotional emails can reduce churn and encourage repeat purchases within 28 days. keyword-based) or surface trending bundles (“Complete the look”) to see which approach not only increases product visibility but also boosts average order value.


**Key Points:**

- For direct-to-consumer brands, data-driven testing is the real game-changer.

### 88. One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/one-tailed-vs-two-tailed-tests


**Summary:**  
If your answer is no—or if you’re not even sure what this means—then this blog is for you! Example: Reviewing the previous graph can help illustrate this: for example, a result in the left tail might be significant under a two-tailed hypothesis but not under a right one-tailed hypothesis. Note that the purple area is larger for the one-tailed hypothesis, compared to the two-tailed hypothesis:
In practice, to maintain the desired power level, we compensate for the reduced power of a two-tailed hypothesis by increasing the sample size (Increasing sample size raises power, though the mechanics of this can be a topic for a separate article).


**Key Points:**

- One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Hypothesis Testing: Understanding the Difference

- Why does it make a difference?

- How to decide between one-tailed and two-tailed hypothesis?

### 89. When allocation point and exposure point differ

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/when-allocation-point-and-exposure-point-differ


**Summary:**  
Since this feature isn’t visible when the page loads, users in the test group might leave before scrolling down to see it. Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not. If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.


**Key Points:**

- Why does it happen?

- Why does it matter?

- What should you do?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not.

- If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.

### 91. You don&#39;t need large sample sizes to run A/B tests

**Date:** 2024-12-12T03:15+00:00  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/you-dont-need-large-sample-sizes-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Yet many small and medium-sized companies aren’t running A/B Tests. Example: Google routinely runs large search tests on a massive scale, for example 100,000,000 users where a+0.1% effect on topline metrics is a big win. A/B testing is a pillar of data-driven product development irrespective of the product’s size
### Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing
Startup companies have a major advantage in experimentation:huge potential and upside.Startups don’t play the micro-optimization game; they don’t care about a +0.2% increase in click-through rates.

### 96. It’s normal not to be normal(ly distributed): what to do when data is not normally distributed

**Date:** 2024-10-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-to-do-when-data-is-not-normally-distributed


**Summary:**  
Gosset wanted to estimate the quality of the company’s beer, but was concerned that existing statistical methods would be unreliable due to a small sample size. Example: A familiar example is election polling: statisticians want to predict the outcome for all voters but must rely on a sample of survey responses. Key statistical principles, such as the Central Limit Theorem and Slutsky’s Theorem, show that as the sample size increases, the t statistic converges toward a normal distribution.


**Key Points:**

- Normal distribution: the KPI follows a normal distribution.

- Non-normal distribution: the KPI has a non-normal distribution.

- William Sealy Gosset, a former Head Brewer at Guinness Brewery, had a problem.

- Why do we need the normality assumption?

- The normality assumption with large sample sizes

- So, t-test it is?

- Example: A familiar example is election polling: statisticians want to predict the outcome for all voters but must rely on a sample of survey responses.

- Key statistical principles, such as the Central Limit Theorem and Slutsky’s Theorem, show that as the sample size increases, the t statistic converges toward a normal distribution.

**Date:** 2024-10-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-rollouts-examples


**Summary:**  
Instagram was becoming the primary medium for keeping tabs on friends and influencers alike—perceiving the world through their iPhone lenses, in a way. Example: Take Spotify Wrapped, for example. I’m not sure if it was always meant to be a temporary feature, or if it simply didn’t increase the metrics that Meta had hoped.


**Key Points:**

- Just got fired from my job:Thankful🌸

- Looking for carpenter recommendations:Thankful🌸

- A compilation of Mark Zuckerberg talking about barbecue sauce:Thankful🌸

- This thankful react thing needs to stop:Thankful🌸

- Tag Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post

- Sign up for my random newsletter

### 100. How A/B testing platforms make data science more interesting

**Date:** 2024-10-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-ab-testing-platforms-make-data-science-more-interesting


**Summary:**  
A/B testing platforms have become highly efficient, automating much of the mundane work involved in setting up, calculating, and reporting on experiments. Example: "An engineer that improves server performance by ten milliseconds more than pays for his or her fully loaded annual costs."
Illustrating the tangible impact of small improvements, Kohavi shared this powerful example. ## Excerpts
"Most experiments fail to improve the metrics they were designed to improve."
Kohavi highlighted a counterintuitive reality: the majority of experiments don't yield the expected positive results.


**Key Points:**

- What’s the current state of experimentation automation since the release of the Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (the "Hippo" book)?

- How does this automation impact the role of data scientists?

- What should data scientists focus on moving forward?

- How can we secure leadership buy-in for experimentation efforts?

- Over the past few years, the data science landscape has fundamentally changed.

- My questions to Ronny:

- Three takeaways

- Experimentation automation benefits data scientists both directly and indirectly

**Date:** 2024-10-09T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimental-meta-analysis-and-knowledge-base


**Summary:**  
Over the past three years, we’ve seen several companies significantly scale their experimentation culture, often increasing their experimentation velocity by 10-30x within a year. Example: For example, if you’ve spent a quarter testing ways to optimize product recommendations in your e-commerce app, an individual experiment might guide a ship decision. Whatnot hit a run rate of 400 experiments last year,Notion scaled from single-digit to hundreds per quarter,Rec Room went from nearly zero to 150 experimentsin their first year with Statsig, andLime started testing every change they roll out.


**Key Points:**

- What experiments are running now?

- When are they expected to end?

- What % of experiments ship Control vs Test?

- What is the typical duration?

- Do experiments run for their planned duration or much longer or shorter?

- Do experiments impact key business metrics or only shallow or team-level metrics?

- How much do they impact key business metrics?

- The value of experimentation compounds as you run more experiments.

### 109. Why you should &#34;accept&#34; the null hypothesis when hypothesis testing

**Date:** 2024-09-25T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-accept-null


**Summary:**  
You can only fail to reject it!” is widely circulated but fundamentally flawed.


**Key Points:**

- Many people mistakenly interpret "accepting" the null as "proving" it, which is incorrect.

- Null and alternative hypotheses treated symmetrically:Both (H_0) and (H_1) are explicitly defined, and tests are designed to decide between them based on the data.

- Fisher:The alternative hypothesis is often implicit or not formally specified. The focus is on assessing evidence against (H_0).

- Neyman-Pearson:The alternative hypothesis ((H_1)) is explicitly defined, and tests are constructed to distinguish between (H_0) and (H_1).

- Fisher:Emphasizes measuring evidence against (H_0) without necessarily making a final decision.

- Neyman-Pearson:Emphasizes making a decision between (H_0) and (H_1), incorporating the long-run frequencies of errors.

- Fisher's Null Hypothesis:A unique, specific hypothesis tested to see if there is significant evidence against it, using p-values as a measure of evidence.

### 110. How much does a feature flag platform cost?

**Date:** 2024-09-23T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/comparing-feature-flag-platform-costs


**Summary:**  
To simplify the process, we’ve put togethera spreadsheet comparing pricing, complete with all the formulas we used and any assumptions we made.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig offers the lowest pricing across all usage levels, with free gates for non-analytics use cases (i.e., if a gate is used for an A/B test).

- Launch Darkly’s cost for client-side SDKs reachesthe highest levels across all platformsafter ~100k MAU.

- PostHog client-side SDK costs stand as the second cheapestacross feature flag platforms while still racking uphundreds of dollars for usage over 1M requests.

- The assumption of 20 sessions per MAU is made on the basis that each active user is assumed to have 20 unique sessions each month.

- One request per session is used, given a standard 1:1 ratio for requests and sessions.

- 20 gates instrumented per MAU made on the assumption of using 20 gates in a given product.

- 50% of gates checked each session is used as a benchmark on the basis of users only triggering half of the gates in a given session.

- One context (client-side users, devices, or organizations that encounter feature flags in a product within a month) per MAU given the close definition of the two.

### 111. Optimizing config propagation time with target apps

**Date:** 2024-09-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sam Miller  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-config-propagation-time-with-target-apps


**Summary:**  
Propagation latency is defined as the time it takes for a change made in the Console to be reflected by the config checks you issue on your frontend or backend systems with our SDKs. Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps.


**Key Points:**

- Performance: By filtering out irrelevant configurations, the payload sent to each SDK instance is smaller, leading to faster initialization times and lower memory usage

- At Statsig, we’re constantly finding ways to drive down what we call config propagation latency.

- What are target apps?

- Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps.

### 113. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Example: Funnels allow you to measure complex relationships with a higher degree of clarity.For example, you see revenue flatten, but product page views are going up. If you care about improving your checkout flow for products, tracking this data at a session level is more powerful, measuring (successes / tries) instead of (successful users / users who tried)
Consider when a user vs.


**Key Points:**

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- Statistical rigor:Make sure funnel conversions have the delta method applied and have sound practices for ordinal logic.

- Ordered events:For funnels to be really useful, you should be able to specify that users do events in a specific sequence over time.

- Multiple-step funnels:Two-step funnels can be useful, but the ability to add intermediate steps as needed for richer understanding is critical.

- Step-level and overall conversion changes:This is how you can identifywheredrop-offs happen.

- Calculation windows:Being able to specify the maximum duration a user has to finish a funnel is critical to running longer experiments.

### 114. CUPED Explained

**Date:** 2024-09-15T00:00-05:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped


**Summary:**  
MeaningControlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data, CUPED is frequently cited as—and used as—one of the most powerful algorithmic tools for increasing the speed and accuracy of experimentation programs. Example: In the example below, it’s pretty obvious that the difference in the groupsbeforethe test would make the results extremely skewed:
You might note that you can see that the weighted runners’ times went up, and the unweighted runners’ times went down. In this article, we’ll:
- Cover the background of CUPED
Cover the background of CUPED
- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
## What CUPED solves:
As an experiment matures and hits its target date for readout, it’s not uncommon to see a result that seems to beonly barelyoutside the range where it would be treated as statistical


**Key Points:**

- Cover the background of CUPED

- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED

- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments

- The effect size in our T-test (the delta between test and control) is exactly the same as the “test” variable’s coefficient in the OLS regression.

- The standard error for the coefficient is the same as the standard error for our T-test.

- The p-value for the “test” variable coefficient is the same as for our t-test!

- Our p-value goes from 0.116 to 0.000 because of the decreased Standard Error. The result, which was previously not statistically significant, is now clearly significant.

- Multiply the pre-experiment population mean byθand add it to each user’s result

### 115. I want it that way: Building experimentation infrastructure and culture with Ronny Kohavi 

**Date:** 2024-09-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Morgan Scalzo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-experimentation-infrastructure-and-culture-ronny-kohavi


**Summary:**  
We recently hosted a virtual meetup featuring Allon Korem, CEO ofBell, and Ronny Kohavi, awidely respected thought leaderand expert in experimentation. Example: For example, a p-value of 0.01 does not mean there is a 99% chance of success. - Experimentation culture: Establishing an organizational culture that embraces experimentation is vital for continuous growth and improvement.


**Key Points:**

- Case study: Only 12% of 1,000 experiments succeeded, illustrating the harsh reality that many organizations must accept—a high failure rate is normal.

- Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches: They covered the differences between these two statistical approaches and their applications in experimentation.

- A/A tests as best practice: RunningA/A testsis strongly recommended to validate experimentation setups and ensure the reliability of testing infrastructure.

- Asymmetric allocation: This approach can provide advantages to the larger group in an experiment, optimizing for specific outcomes.

- You can always learn something from people with lots of experience.

- Key insights from Ronny Kohavi

- Should every organization aim for "fly" in every category?

- Discussion on failures

### 117. How Meta made me a big-time A/B testing advocate

**Date:** 2024-09-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/meta-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
I wanted to show my data scientist audience how powerful Deltoid is, yet was prohibited from doing so as it’s an internal tool. Example: For example, inan earlier video, I discussed how AB testing shapes the meritocracy and competitive culture at Facebook. We found thatthe white background caused a decrease in click-through rate and conversion rate:It made users feel like they were in a traditional e-commerce experience, rather than browsing for deals.


**Key Points:**

- I recordedStatsig’s first public demoover three years ago.

- Measuring our failure

- Understanding our failure

- The difference a white background can make

- The counterfactual of no A/B testing

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, inan earlier video, I discussed how AB testing shapes the meritocracy and competitive culture at Facebook.

**Author:** Sedona Duggal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-much-does-an-experimentation-platform-cost


**Summary:**  
To simplify this process, we made a detailed pricing model that breaks down costs across the most popular experimentation platforms, complete with all our assumptions and calculations. Example: The graph above shows an example, but enterprise contracts vary.*
### Key insights
- Statsig and VWO offer the cheapest experimentation platform at low volumes (< 100K MAU)

## Other things to consider
When evaluating experimentation


**Key Points:**

- Monthly Active Users (MAU) act as a standardized benchmark across platforms. It is assumed that 100% of MAU are tracked (monthly tracked users (MTU))

- Each monthly user creates 20 unique sessions per month

- One request (or exposure event) is used per session

- 5 analytics events are used per session

- 20 gates are instrumented per session (this would mean that 20 gates exist within the product)

- 50% of gates are checked each session (meaning half of the 20 gates are used by the average user)

- Statsig and VWO offer the cheapest experimentation platform at low volumes (< 100K MAU)

- Statsig offers enterprise pricing starting at around 200K MAU, making it cheapest and most scalable option at higher volumes

### 119. What is A/B testing and why is it important?

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-is-a-b-testing-and-why-is-it-important


**Summary:**  
Underlying AB testing is the concept of “randomized controlled trials (RCTs).” It is the gold standard in finding causality. Example: Let’s use one quick example, which also illustrates what “random assignment” is and its importance. ## Understanding treatment effect with an example
Suppose I claim that I have a magic pill that costs $100 and can increase the height of high school students by 1 inch over a year.


**Key Points:**

- With randomized assignments, the difference between the treatment group and the control group iscaused by the treatment.

- Test group:1000 students who voluntarily took the pill a year ago. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 62 inches this year.

- Control group:1000 students from the same schools with the same age. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 61 inches this year.

- Claim:We shipped a feature and metrics increased 10%

- Reality:The metrics will increase 10% without the feature, such as shipping a Black Friday banner before Black Friday.

- Claim:We shipped a feature, and users who use the feature saw 10% increase in their metrics

- Reality:The users who self-select into using the feature would see a 10% increase without the feature, such as giving a button to power users(ref: why most aha moments are wrong?)

- Humans are bad at attributions and are subject to lots of biases

### 121. Technical insights to a scalable experimentation system

**Date:** 2024-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/technical-insights-to-a-scalable-experimentation-system


**Summary:**  
(2022)highlighted, establishing trust in experimental results is challenging. Example: For example, a differential baseline between groups prior to a treatment is not statistically biased, but it is undesirable for making business decisions and usually requires resetting the test. In such cases, the cost of maintaining more experiments increases super-linearly, while the benefits increase sub-linearly.


**Key Points:**

- Historical Relevance:Experiments serve both decision-making and learning purposes, requiring a comprehensive understanding of both current and past experiments.

- Managerial incentives often encourage detrimental behaviors, such as p-hacking.

- Experiments may result in technical debt by leaving configurations within the codebase.

- The marginal return of experiments increases linearly or sub-linearly with scale, as less effort is available to turn information into impact.

- The marginal cost of experiments increases super-linearly with scale due to information and managerial overhead.

- Default-on experiments on all new features.

- Define metrics once, use everywhere.

- Reliable, traceable, and transparent data.

### 124. Why the uplift in A/B tests often differs from real-world results

**Date:** 2024-08-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-the-uplift-in-a-b-tests-often-differs-from-real-world


**Summary:**  
This disconnect can be puzzling and disappointing, especially when decisions and expectations are built around these tests. Example: A common example I’ve encountered with clients involves tests that yield inconclusive (non-significant) results. While reducing the significance level can decrease the number of false positives, it would also require longer test durations, which may not always be feasible.


**Key Points:**

- Human bias in analysis and interpretation

- False positives

- Sequential testing and overstated effect sizes

- Novelty effect and user behavior

- External validity and real-world factors

- Limited exposure in testing

- Strategies for mitigating discrepancies

### 126. How to pick metrics that make or break your experiments (including do&#39;s and don&#39;ts)

**Date:** 2024-08-14T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Elizabeth George  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-metrics-that-make-or-break-your-experiments


**Summary:**  
In fact, the wrong metrics can not only mislead your results but can also derail your entire strategy.


**Key Points:**

- Have a razor-sharp focus on one primary behavioral metric and a clearly aligned business metric.

- Anticipate and measure the negative consequences of your changes—because they’re inevitable.

- Use secondary metrics to fill in the gaps in your understanding. Without them, you’re operating in the dark.

- Ensure your experiment has enough power to provide conclusive, reliable results. Anything less is a waste of time.

- Stick with the same business metric for every experiment. If it doesn’t align with your specific goals, it’s irrelevant.

- Overcomplicate your analysis with a laundry list of metrics. Clarity and focus are your allies; distraction is your enemy.

- Over-interpret secondary data. If it’s not part of your primary hypothesis, it’s noise—don’t let it lead you astray.

- Your experiments are only as good as the metrics you choose.

### 127. How to plan test duration when using CUPED

**Date:** 2024-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-plan-test-duration-cuped


**Summary:**  
You understand that failing to plan the test duration can lead to underpowered tests and inflated false positive rates due to peeking. Example: Example:
In reality, we don't know the true values of the variables, so we must estimate them. Recently, you've been introduced toCUPED, an advanced statistical method that reduces KPI variance, resulting in more sensitive tests (lower MDE) or shorter test durations (lower sample size).


**Key Points:**

- Calculate the Non-CUPED Sample Size: Use the regular t-test sample size formula.

- Adjust Sample Size: Reduce the calculated sample size by the factor of \(\rho^2\).

- Suppose the non-CUPED sample size is 1000.

- Historical sampled data shows an estimated Pearson correlation of 0.9 between \(X\) and \(Y\).

- Calculate the variance reduction factor: \(0.9^2 = 0.81\).

- Adjust the sample size: \(1000 \times (1 - 0.81) = 190\).

- What is test planning and why is it important?

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-i-saved-my-experiment-from-outliers


**Summary:**  
This is why health checks are acriticalpart of an experimentation platform—the more you’re proactively alerted about potential issues, the less likely you are to make a bad ship decision—and worse (in this case), have a bad learning experience.


**Key Points:**

- Change/Add winsorization to manage the influence of these outlier users, or add metric caps to a reasonable number like 5 signup clicks/day

- Use an explore query or qualifying event filter to eliminate these two users from the analysis

- Use an event-user metric instead

### 134. Controlling your type I errors: Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg

**Date:** 2024-07-31T10:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/controlling-type-i-errors-bonferroni-benjamini-hochberg


**Summary:**  
TheBenjamini-Hochberg Procedureis now available on Statsig as a way to reduce your false positives. Example: - FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons
FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons
- FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it
FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it
For each metric evaluation of one variant vs the control, we have:
In any online experiment, we’re likely to have more than just 1 metric and one variant in a given experiment, for example:
We generally recommend the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure as a less severe measure than the Bonferroni Correction, but which still protects you from some amount Type I errors.


**Key Points:**

- (Type I Error) I’m making unnecessary changes that don’t actually improve our product.

- (Type II Error) I missed an opportunity to make our product better because I didn’t detect a difference in my experiment.

- FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons

- FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it

- Bonferroni vs Benjamini-Hochberg

- Try it with Statsig

### 135. Hypothesis Testing explained in 4 parts

**Date:** 2024-07-22T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-explained


**Summary:**  
As data scientists, Hypothesis Testing is expected to be well understood, but often not in reality. It is mainly because our textbooks blend two schools of thought – p-value and significance testing vs. Example: For example, some questions are not obvious unless you have thought through them before:
- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis? Third, to illustrate the two concepts concisely, let’s run a visualization by just changing the sample size from 30 to 100 and see how power increases from 86.3% to almost 100%.


**Key Points:**

- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis?

- Can we accept the null hypothesis? Why?

- How does MDE change with alpha holding beta constant?

- Why do we use standard error in Hypothesis Testing but not the standard deviation?

- Why can’t we be specific about the alternative hypothesis so we can properly model it?

- Why is the fundamental tradeoff of the Hypothesis Testing about mistake vs. discovery, not about alpha vs. beta?

- We emphasize a clear distinction between the standard deviation and the standard error, and why the latter is used in Hypothesis Testing

- We explain fully when can you “accept” a hypothesis, when shall you say “failing to reject” instead of “accept”, and why

### 137. Top 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them

**Date:** 2024-07-18T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/top-8-common-experimentation-mistakes-how-to-fix


**Summary:**  
I recently down with Allon Korem, CEO ofBell Statistics, and Tyler VanHaren, Software Engineer at Statsig, to discuss some of the most frequent mistakes companies can make in A/B testing and experimentation! I've summarized the discussion and outlined the 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them. By addressing these common testing mistakes, companies can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of their A/B tests.


**Key Points:**

- Data integrity:Ensure that your allocation point is consistent and verify your distributions using chi-squared tests to detect sample ratio mismatches.

- Skepticism and Vigilance:Regularly check data integrity over different segments and time periods to identify inconsistencies early.

- Proper Metrics:Collaborate with data science teams to ensure metrics are correctly defined and measured, focusing on meaningful business-driven KPIs.

- Statistical Methods:Use t-tests for means and z-tests for proportions in most cases. Ensure your statistical tests are relevant to your hypotheses.

- Peeking:Use sequential testing approaches to manage peeking. Tools like Statsig provide inflated confidence intervals for early data to mitigate premature conclusions.

- Underpowered Tests:Plan tests meticulously using power analysis calculators to ensure you have sufficient data to detect the expected changes.

- Handling Outliers:Use Windsorization to cap extreme values rather than removing outliers entirely, maintaining the integrity of your data.

- Cultural Challenges:Foster a culture that encourages upfront hypothesis formulation and continuous learning from experimentation.

### 138. Introducing Differential Impact Detection 

**Date:** 2024-07-17T09:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/differential-impact-detection


**Summary:**  
Statsig can now automatically surface heterogenous treatment effects across your user properties. In experimentation “one size fits all” is not always true. Example: For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users. For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users.


**Key Points:**

- Investigate the top sub-populations across each user property that you specify as a “Segment of Interest”

- For each primary metric in the experiment, determine if any sub-population has a different response to treatment

- Automatically surface a visualization of metrics sliced by user segments where one or more sub-population behaves significantly differently from the rest of the population

- Apply Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparison (check implementation details at the end)

- Concise Summarization of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Using Total Variation Regularized Regression

- Online Controlled Experiments: Introduction, Pitfalls, and Scaling(see pitfall 6: failing to look at segments)

- What are Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and why do we care?

### 139. Identifying and experimenting with Power Users using Statsig

**Date:** 2024-07-16T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Mike London   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/identifying-experimenting-power-users-statsig


**Summary:**  
For most companies, power users are the driving force behind the success of many digital products, wielding significant influence and engagement compared to the average user. They are not only highly active and skilled with the features of a product, but they also often serve as brand ambassadors, providing valuable feedback and promoting the product within their networks. Example: - For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months. - For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months.


**Key Points:**

- For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months. The data helps you determine the power users. Quantitative.

- For example,at Statsig we have a customer advisory board and are in constant communication with customers via interviews and Slack channels. Qualitative.

### 140. How to Ingest Data Into Statsig

**Date:** 2024-07-16T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Logan Bates  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-ingest-data-into-statsig


**Summary:**  
During my endeavors as a data engineer, I’d spend hours helping teams translate data models and building data pipelines between software tools so they could effectively communicate. The frustration of getting the data into tools often spoiled the intended initial experience and added complexities to a production implementation. Event filters can be utilized to reduce downstream event volume to Statsig, so only your relevant metrics are analyzed.


**Key Points:**

- Access to your data source (e.g., data warehouse, 3rd party data tool/CDP, or application code).

- Necessary permissions to read from and write to your data source. (if applicable)

- Familiarity with SQL (if you're using a data warehouse)

- Use thelogEventmethod in various languages to quickly populate Statsig with data for experimentation and analysis

- Log additional metrics alongside 3rd party or internal logging systems to enhance measurement capabilities

- Use in situations where the SDKs are not supported or preferred

- Can be used to support custom metric ingestion workflows

- Quickly populate Statsig with metric data and analyze with themetrics explorer

### 141. Product experimentation best practices

**Date:** 2024-07-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-experimentation-best-practices


**Summary:**  
A good design document eliminates much of the ambiguity and uncertainty often encountered in the analysis and decision-making stages. Example: For example:
- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
### Power analysis, allocation, and duration
Allocation
This is the percentage of the user base that will be eligible for this experiment. These often include:
- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Se


**Key Points:**

- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)

- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)

- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric

- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs

- Running concurrent, mutually exclusive experiments requires allocating a fraction of the user base to each experiment.  On Statsig this is handled withLayers.

- A smaller allocation may be preferable for high-risk experiments, especially when the overall user base is large enough.

- For guardrail metrics: The MDE should be the largest regression size you’re willing to miss and ship unknowingly.

- Use power analysis to determine the duration needed to reach the MDE for each the those primary metrics. If they yield different results, pick the longest one.

### 144. An overview of making early decisions on experiments 

**Date:** 2024-07-05T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Mike London   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/making-early-decisions-on-experiments


**Summary:**  
Online experimentation is becoming more commonplace across all types of businesses today. #### Rewards:
- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.


**Key Points:**

- Noisy data:Early data can be noisy and may not represent the true effect of the experiment, leading to incorrect conclusions (higher likelihood of false positives/false negatives).

- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.

- Resource allocation:Identifying a strong positive or negative trend can help decide whether to continue investing resources in the experiment.

- Select a population: Choose the appropriate population for your experiment. This could be based on a past experiment, a qualifying event, or the entire user base.

- Choose metrics: Input the metrics you plan to use as your evaluation criteria. You can add multiple metrics to analyze sensitivity in your target population.

- Run the power analysis: Provide the above inputs to the tool. Statsig will simulate an experiment, calculating population sizes and variance based on historical behavior.

- Review the readout: Examine the week-by-week simulation results. This will show estimates of the number of users eligible for the experiment each day, derived from historical data.

- It can shrink confidence intervals and p-values, which means that statistically significant results can be achieved with a smaller sample size.

### 145. Understanding significance levels: A key to accurate data analysis

**Date:** 2024-07-03  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-significance-levels-a-key-to-accurate-data-analysis


**Summary:**  
In this post, we provide an introduction to significance levels, what they are, and why they are important for data analysis. Example: For example, let's say you're comparing two versions of a feature using an A/B test. A lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) reduces the risk offalse positivesbut increases the risk of false negatives.


**Key Points:**

- P-values don't measure the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false.

- A statistically significant result doesn't necessarily imply practical significance or importance.

- The significance level (α) is not the probability of making a Type I error (false positive).

- In fields like medicine or aviation, where false positives can have severe consequences, a lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) may be more appropriate.

- For exploratory studies or when false negatives are more problematic, a higher significance level (e.g., 0.10) might be justified.

- P-values don't provide information about themagnitude or practical importanceof an effect.

- Focusing exclusively on p-values can lead to thefile drawer problem, where non-significant results are less likely to be published, creating a biased literature.

- P-values are influenced by sample size; large samples can yield statistically significant results for small, practically unimportant effects.

### 149. Statsig&#39;s Autotune adds contextual bandits for personalization

**Date:** 2024-06-26T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-autotune-contextual-bandits-personalization


**Summary:**  
These contextual bandits are a lightweight form of reinforcement learning that gives teams an easy way to personalize user experiences. Example: For example, a contextual bandit is a great choice to personalize if a user should see “Sports”, “Science”, or “Celebrities” as their top video unit; but it won’t be a good fit for determining which video (with new candidates every day, and with potentially tens of thousands of options) to show them. Running a few tests with Autotune AI can quickly give signal on how much there is to gain from personalizing product surfaces - potentially justifying investing in a dedicated team
## Start measuring your personalization
Hundreds of customers already use Statsig to measure improvements to theirpersonalization program.


**Key Points:**

- Don’t yet have the bandwidth to solve these problems, but want a placeholder for personalization as their teams get more mission-critical parts of their product built

- We’re excited to announce that Statsig’s multi-armed bandit platform (Autotune)now includes contextual bandits.

- When to use contextual bandits

- Hit the perfect note with Autotuned experiments

### 150. Warehouse Native Year in Review

**Date:** 2024-06-25T12:15-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/warehouse-native-year-in-review


**Summary:**  
Since then, Warehouse Native has grown into a core product for us; we treat it with the same priority as Statsig Cloud, and have developed the two products to share core infrastructure, methodology, and design philosophies. Example: - More tools in the warehouse; for example, we have a beta version ofMetrics Explorerfor warehouse native customers and are excited to continue developing this - sharing a metric definition language between quick metric explorations and advanced statistical calculations helps bridge the gap between exploratory work and rigorous measurement. One of the competitive advantages we think Statsig has is “clock speed” - we just build faster than other teams building the same thing.


**Key Points:**

- Willingness - and internal/external alignment - to ship things that were functional-but-ugly

- Letting the development team play to their strengths

- Treating early customers like team members

- An Engineering “Code Machine” - someone who could crank out quality code twice as fast as other engineers

- A PM “Tech Lead” - someone who leads efforts across the company

- A DS “Product Hybrid” - someone who bridges product and engineering to solve complex business problems

- A year ago, Statsig announced Warehouse Native, bringing our experimentation platform into customers’ Data Warehouses.

- Why warehouse native?

### 159. How to debug your experiments and feature rollouts

**Date:** 2024-05-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-debug-your-experiments-and-feature-rollouts


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a product manager, or a software engineer, you know that even the most meticulously planned test rollout can encounter unexpected hiccups. Example: Statsig also allows you to override specific users, for example, if you wanted to test your feature with employees first in production. Statsig also offersstratified sampling; When experimenting on a user base where a tail-end of power users drive a large portion of an overall metric value, stratified sampling meaningfully reduces false positive rates and makes your results more consistent and trustworthy.


**Key Points:**

- Inadequate sampling: A sample that's too small or not representative of an evenly weighted distribution can lead to inconclusive or misleading results.

- Lack of confidence in metrics: Without trustworthy success metrics, it's harder to determine how to make a decision.

- User exposure issues: If users aren't exposed to the experiment as intended, your data won't reflect their true behavior.

- Biased experiments: Running multiple experiments that affect the same variables can contaminate your results.

- Technical errors: Bugs in the code can introduce unexpected variables that impact the experiment's outcome.

- Success criteria: Before launching an experiment, it's crucial to define how you’re measuring success. Make these metrics readily available for analysis.

- Running experiments mutually exclusively: To prevent experiments from influencing each other, consider using feature flagging frameworks.

- When it comes to digital experimentation and feature rollouts, the devil is often in the details.

**Date:** 2024-04-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-experiments-beginners-guide


**Summary:**  
Traditionally, A/B testing has been dominated by Frequentist statistics, which rely on p-values and confidence intervals to make decisions. - Prior information is available: If you have reliable historical data or expert knowledge, Bayesian experiments can use that information to improve the accuracy of the results.


**Key Points:**

- Small sample sizes: When you have limited data, Bayesian methods can be more robust since they can leverage prior information to make up for the lack of data.

- Sequential analysis: Bayesian experiments are well-suited for situations where you want to look at the results continuously and potentially stop the test early.

- Complex models: If you're dealing with complex models or multiple metrics, Bayesian methods can help manage the intricacies more effectively.

- Prior information is available: If you have reliable historical data or expert knowledge, Bayesian experiments can use that information to improve the accuracy of the results.

- Flexibility: Bayesian experiments can be updated continuously as new data comes in, making them well-suited for dynamic environments where conditions change rapidly.

- Clear decision-making: With Bayesian testing, you can quantify the risk associated with a decision, such as the expected loss if a new feature underperforms.

- A Statsig account with access to the experiments feature.

- A clear hypothesis and defined metrics for your experiment.

### 182. Experimentation metrics in software development (with examples!)

**Date:** 2024-04-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-metrics-software-development-examples


**Summary:**  
This is the same vibe, just with different tools. At the heart of this process are the metrics themselves, which serve as the compass guiding developers toward improved user experiences, performance, and business outcomes.


**Key Points:**

- Validate hypotheses:By measuring the effect of changes, metrics can confirm or refute the assumptions behind a new feature or improvement.

- Make data-driven decisions:Instead of relying on gut feelings or opinions, metrics provide objective data that can inform the next steps.

- Understand user behavior:Metrics can reveal how users interact with your product, which features they value, and where they encounter friction.

- Optimize product performance:From load times to resource usage, metrics can highlight areas for technical refinement.

- User retention rate:This metric tracks the percentage of users who return to the product over a specific period after their initial visit or sign-up.

- Churn rate:The churn rate calculates the percentage of users who stop using the product within a given timeframe, indicating customer satisfaction and product stickiness.

- Session duration:The average length of a user's session provides insights into user engagement and the product's ability to hold users' attention.

- Conversion rate:This metric measures the percentage of users who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter.

### 183. Why warehouse native experimentation

**Date:** 2024-04-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/warehouse-native-experimentation-value-props


**Summary:**  
Last month, we hosted a virtual meetup featuring our Data Scientist, Craig Sexauer, and special guest Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager, Machine Learning, from Whatnot, to discuss warehouse native experimentation. Jared noted that Whatnot's experimentation costs and efficiency improved because they only accessed data when needed for an experiment — which can now be done on the fly.


**Key Points:**

- Asingle source of truthfor data

- Flexibility aroundcost/complexity tradeoffsfor measurement

- Flexibly re-analyze experiment results

- Easy access to results for experimentmeta-analysis

- Warehouse native experimentation is like having a large in-house team building a platform at a fraction of the cost.

- What is warehouse-native experimentation?

- Who is warehouse native experimentation for?

- What's the value proposition of warehouse native?

### 184. The role of confidence levels in statistical analysis

**Date:** 2024-04-04T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/confidence-levels-in-statistical-analysis


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a business analyst, or just someone interested in understanding the nuances of statistical inference, grasping the concept of confidence levels is crucial. Example: For example, a 95% confidence level suggests that if we were to conduct the same study 100 times, we would expect the true parameter to fall within our calculated confidence interval in 95 out of those 100 times.


**Key Points:**

- The sample statistic (e.g., the sample mean)

- The standard error of the statistic

- The desired confidence level

- CI:This stands for "Confidence Interval." It represents the range within which we expect the population mean to lie, given our sample mean and level of confidence.

- Sample Mean: This is the average value of your sample data. It is denoted by the symbol `x̄` (x-bar).

- ±:This symbol indicates that the confidence interval has two bounds: an upper bound and a lower bound.

- What is a confidence level?

- Get more confidence!

### 190. Novelty effects: Everything you need to know

**Date:** 2024-03-20T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/novelty-effects


**Summary:**  
Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness. Example: For example, feature level funnel, and feature level retention, can tell us whether users finished using the feature as we intended and whether they come back to the feature. Imagine this – the restaurant you pass by every day had a 100% improvement on their menu, their chef and their services.


**Key Points:**

- Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness.

- Not all products have novelty effects. They exist mostly in high-frequency products.

- Ignoring the temporary nature of novelty effects may lead to incorrect product decisions, and worse, bad culture.

- The most effective way to find novelty effects and control them is to examinethe time series of treatment effects.

- The root cause solution is to use a set of metrics that correctly represent user intents.

- When understood and used correctly, novelty effects can help you.

- Novelty effects are part of the treatment effects, so there is no statistical method to detect them generically

- Novelty effects are dangerous and will spread if you don’t combat them

### 191. How to monitor the long term effects of your experiment

**Date:** 2024-03-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-monitor-the-long-term-effects-of-your-experiment


**Summary:**  
Now, imagine discovering six months later that it actually reduced long-term retention. Example: Let's get practical with an example from Statsig.


**Key Points:**

- User behavior is unpredictable: Users might initially react positively to a new feature but lose interest over time.

- External factors: Events outside your control, such as a global pandemic, can drastically alter user engagement and skew your experiment results.

- You then model these early signals against historical data of known long-term outcomes. This helps predict the eventual impact on retention.

- It's important to choose surrogate indexes wisely. They must have a proven correlation with the long-term outcome you care about.

- Engaged user biasmeans you're mostly hearing from your power users. They're not your average customer, so their feedback might lead you down a narrow path.

- Selective sampling issuesoccur when you only look at a subset of users. This might make you miss out on broader trends.

- Diversify your data sources: Don't rely solely on one type of user feedback. Look at a mix of both highly engaged users and those less active.

- Use stratified sampling: This means you'll divide your user base into smaller groups or strata based on characteristics like usage frequency. Then, sample evenly from these groups.

### 192. Demystifying identity resolution

**Date:** 2024-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/demystifying-identity-resolution


**Summary:**  
The notion of “identity resolution” in the SaaS world continues to be an elusive gold standard that businesses want to solve in order to understand the full scope of customer behaviors across all touch-points. Example: ## Example ID resolution scenarios
Scenario 1:An unknown user visits the website and gets assigned to the “Test” group fornav_v2experiment using via a deviceID.


**Key Points:**

- No technology providers will solve every use-case and scenario perfectly, though many will make bold claims. There is a ton of nuance here and no one-size-fits-all solution.

- It is strictly impossible to reliably identify a single human interacting anonymously on two different devices that never identify themselves.

- Unknown user identity becomes the crux of the challenge. When switching devices, browsers, environments (server vs. client), or clearing device storage, this ID will not persist.

- The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds.

- A few disclaimers, debunkings, and considerations as we dive in:

- Identity boundary basics

- What does this have to do with experimentation?

- At the Point of assignment

**Author:** Sid Kumar and Skye Scofield   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/evaluate-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
Vitamin products make you better over time, but they don’t solve an acute problem right away.For many companies, experimentation platforms can feel like a vitamin product. Example: For example, if you're migrating from LaunchDarkly, you can take advantage of Statsig'smigration toolthat lets you port your feature flags in under 5 minutes! Experimentation platforms also fix other acute pain points, including:
- Giving teams a single source of truth for key product & growth metrics

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ad-blockers-feature-management-testing-tools


**Summary:**  
There are many browser extensions out there today available to web users that help them block pesky ads around the web.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig’s presence on the block lists is less than other providers at the time of writing this, likely due to the fact that we were founded more recently—but this could change!

### 202. Onboarding for growth with A/B tests

**Date:** 2023-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/onboarding-for-growth-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
For B2B SaaS applications, a user’s very first login or download experience has a significant influence on their engagement metrics. Example: Example experiment hypothesis: Tooltip pop-ups at every screen might empower users to progress through the onboarding workflow, thereby increasing the percentage of onboarding completions and subsequently active usage. The quicker you guide them to this revelation (decrease time-to-value), the more likely they are to become sticky, which significantly impacts core metrics such as daily active users (DAU) and ultimately retention and net recurring revenue (NRR).


**Key Points:**

- Incorporating contextual tooltips or pop-ups that empower users to navigate through the workflow (sometimes even including a brief autoplay tutorial)

- Highlighting specific high-value feature(s) that give early wins for users

- Featuring a “one-click quick start” or similar capability that automatically configures basic parameters for immediate use of features

- Offering different plans such as a free trial with limited features vs a premium trial with full access

- Personalizing messaging based on the user's persona such as their industry or role

- Offering discounts in the eleventh hour is not the growth strategy of champions.

- Successful onboarding-for-growth implementations

- Testing and identifying winning features

### 205. Online experimentation: The new paradigm for building AI applications

**Date:** 2023-04-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Palak Goel and Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-products-require-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:
First, product managers would come up with a new idea for a product and lay out a release timeline. Example: But the risks are palpable—for every AI success story, there’s an example of a biased model sharing misinformation, or a feature being pulled due to safety concerns. #### In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today.


**Key Points:**

- How can you launch and iterate on features quickly without compromising your existing user experience?

- How can you move fast while ensuring your apps are safe and reliable?

- How can you ensure that the features you launch lead to substantive, differentiated improvements in user outcomes?

- How can you identify the optimal prompts and models for your specific use case?

- Build compelling AI features that engage users

- Flight dozens of models, prompts and parameters in the ‘back end’ of these features

- Collect data on all inputs and outputs

- Use this data to select the best-performing variant and fine-tune new models

### 206. Less is more: Metric directionality

**Date:** 2023-02-14T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Matt Garnes  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/metric-directionality


**Summary:**  
Within Statsig, we celebrate these increases when they are statistically significant with a deep, satisfying, green color:
## When up isn’t good
But what about when thisisn’tthe case? Example: ## Real-world example: Performance improvement
We ran into a case like this at Statsig when we ran an experiment to load content from the next page when your cursor hovers on the link, since you might visit there imminently.


**Key Points:**

- the count of crashes in your app

- removals of items from a shopping cart

- For most measurements we make in product development, we want the value to go “up and to the right.”

- When up isn’t good

### 209. The Importance of Design in B2B SaaS

**Date:** 2022-09-29T00:00-04:00  
**Author:** Geunbae &#34;GB&#34; Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-importance-of-design-in-b2b-saas


**Summary:**  
The expectations of a delightful user experience—previously reserved for the realm of B2C products—have bled into B2B space as well, with enterprise customers expecting to be delighted by the look and feel of the products that they’re using. Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.


**Key Points:**

- A well-designed product is a strong foundation

- A well-designed product is your value prop, an edge vs. competitors

- A well-designed product helps your team to move faster

- A well-designed product is key in establishing your brand

- Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.

### 210. Statsig—Now With Your Warehouse

**Date:** 2022-09-15T00:00-04:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-with-your-warehouse


**Summary:**  
This makes it so that you can use your existing events and metrics with Statsig’s experimentation engine. Based on the previous pain points, we built the new approach with the following goals in mind:
- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started
Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started
- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
- Keep things consistent: We’ll treat your imported data just the same as SDK data, materializing into experiment results, creating tracking datasets, and eventually allowing you to explore it in tools like Events Explorer.


**Key Points:**

- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started

- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig

- In your Statsig metrics page, you’ll be able to find the new “Ingestions” tab

- Here, you can give us connection information for one of the supported data warehouses

- You’ll give us a SQL snippet that provides a view for your base metric or event data. This can be as simple as aSELECT *from your existing table!

- In the console, you’ll be able to map your existing fields into Statsig fields

- Once that’s done you can preview the data we’ll pull, set an ingestion schedule, and optionally load some recent historical data to get started.

- Running a scheduled pull and processing your data on your chosen schedule

### 211. Understanding the role of the 95% confidence interval

**Date:** 2022-08-04T16:31:57.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/95-percent-confidence-interval


**Summary:**  
Yet its validity and usefulness is often questioned. Example: For example, startup companies that have a high risk tolerance will want to minimize false negatives by selecting lower confidence intervals (e.g., 80% or 90%). I’m a proponent of 95%confidence intervalsand recommend them as a solid default.


**Key Points:**

- A range of plausible values

- An indicator of how repeatable/stable our experimental method is

- It’s a reasonable low bar.In practice, it’s an achievable benchmark for most fields of research to remain productive.

- It’s ubiquitous.It ensures we’re all speaking the same language. What one team within your company considers significant is the same as another team.

- Set your confidence threshold BEFORE any data is collected. Cheaters change the confidence interval after there’s an opportunity to peek.

- Gelman, Andrew (Nov. 5, 2016).“Why I prefer 50% rather than 95% intervals”.

- Gelman, Andrew (Dec 28, 2017).“Stupid-ass statisticians don’t know what a goddam confidence interval is”.

### 213. CUPED on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-07-07T21:55:42.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics. Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).


**Key Points:**

- The more stable a metric tends to be for the same user over time, the more CUPED can reduce variance and pre-experiment bias

- CUPED utilizespre-exposuredata for users, so experiments on new users or newly logged metrics won’t be able to leverage this technique

- Getting in the habit of setting up key metrics and starting to track metrics before an experiment starts will help you to get the most out of CUPED on Statsig

- Run experiments with more speed and accuracy

- How this will help you

- Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).

- Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics.

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/leading-a-team-of-lions


**Summary:**  
Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear.”
… wroteC.S. Example: Three working principles that I rely on heavily:
- Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
- Make it trivial to test a change with a small section of users, and progressively expand the blast radius; for example, start by dog-fooding features with internal employees, then open up to a small group customers, say, who asked for the feature, then expand more broadly
Make it trivial to test a change with a small section of users, and progressively expand the blast radius; for example, start by dog-fooding features with internal employees, then open u


**Key Points:**

- Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works

- Use reliable tools to roll back with ease when things don’t go as expected

- Training your team to make independent decisions

- Generals are humans too

- Training the Team

- 1. Build a shared understanding of business

### 215. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Example: For example, if you typed “#m lgtm” the bot would respond with the macro lgtm, an image of a doge saying looks good to me. A few main reasons:
- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.


**Key Points:**

- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Within the Admin Panel -> Select Integrations -> Click Create custom integration

- Within Permissions, check “Group chat bot”, “Message any member”, and “Read all messages”

- You should get back a url that looks like this:http://71c8-216-207-142-218.ngrok.io. Input that as the callback url in the page webhook.

- Open uphttp://localhost:4040/in your browser. Here is where you can see requests sent and received by your webhook.

- Create a new Workplace group chat with your favorite coworkers and your bot, and trigger your bot by calling one of your macros such as “#m lgtm”

- Usehttp://localhost:4040/and console to debug as needed

### 217. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
They’re trying several ideas at any given time. If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.


**Key Points:**

- Have a clear set of questions the holdout is designed to answer. This will guide your design, holdout duration, value you get and will dictate what costs make sense to incur.

- Understand the costs associated with holdouts. Make sure teams that will pay those costs understand holdout goals and buy in.

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Feature Level Holdouts

- Measuring Cumulative Impact

- If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.

### 218. There’s More To Learn From Tests

**Date:** 2022-04-20T18:45:44.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts!) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way. Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.


**Key Points:**

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

- The target population is split randomly for a test, where some get the solution (Test) and some don’t (Control)

- Unrealized Value: Testing to Understand

- Don’t Waste Your Tests: Take Time to Think About The Results

- Parting Thoughts

- Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.

### 220. Modernizing the Customer Data Stack

**Date:** 2022-04-18T21:30:15.000Z  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/modernizing-the-customer-data-stack


**Summary:**  
There are two key factors influencing this rapid modernization:
- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.


**Key Points:**

- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.

- Businesses want to leverage rapidly evolving and automated data intelligence inside their customer-facing applications.

- Websites, mobile applications and server side applications.

- If a business is generating calculated metrics, model outputs or cohorts in a warehouse, that ultimately becomes a data producer as well.

- Help desks, payment systems, marketing tools, A/B testing tools, ad platforms, CRMs, etc.

- Too many custom pipelines, SDKs and transformations decrease the fidelity and manageability of data over time.

- It’s impossible to enforce schema standardization across channels without introducing latency (Everyone loves a bolt onMDM… right?).

- It’s impossible to resolve user identities across channels without complex user identity services, which introduce latency.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/we-fooled-ourselves-first


**Summary:**  
While the sales team wrangled everyone around a Magic 8 Ball, Vijaye Raji (Founder & CEO) had his own April 1st surprise gated on the company’s website and he used Statsig’s own Feature Gates to test it out. Example: A common example (that Statsig’s website uses as well) isGDPRcookie consent for countries in the EU.

### 223. Democratizing Experimentation

**Date:** 2022-03-21T05:41:41.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/democratizing-experimentation


**Summary:**  
When building out instant games on Facebook a few years back, a new developer switched to use a newer version of an internal SDK. Example: (once measures turn into goals, it’s possible to incent behavior that’s undesirable unless we’re prudent; see theHanoi Rat Problemfor an interesting example)
Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want? A more experienced teammate noticed the change reduced time spent in the game.


**Key Points:**

- Is the metric movement explainable?

- Are all significant movements being reported, not just the positive ones?

- Are guardrail metrics being violated?

- Is there a quota we’re drawing from?

- Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want?

- Guarding againstp-hacking (or selective reporting)(often by establishing guidelines like using ~14 day windows to report results over;see more about reading results safely here.)

- Amazon famously reduced distractions during checkout flows to improve conversion. This is a pattern that most ecommerce sites now optimize for.

- Experiment Review Best Practices

### 227. Introducing Autotune: Statsig’s Multiarmed Bandit

**Date:** 2022-02-03T20:33:11.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-autotune


**Summary:**  
MAB is a well-known probability problem that involves balancing exploration vs exploitation (Ref. Example: ### Case Study: A Real Autotune Test on statsig.com
Statsig’s website (www.statsig.com) showcases Statsig’s products and offerings. We provide a few parameters to play with, but for most use-cases you can use the defaults like we did:
- exploration window (default = 24 hrs) — The initial time that Autotune will evenly split traffic.


**Key Points:**

- Determining which product(s) to feature on a one-day Black Friday sale (resource = time, payout = revenue).

- Showing the best performing ad given a limited budget (resource = budget, payout = clicks/visits).

- Selecting the best signup flow given a finite amount of new users (resource = new users, payout = signups).

- Maximizing Gain:When resources are scarce and maximizing payoff is critical.

- Multiple Variations:Bandits are good at focusing traffic on the most promising variations. Bandits can be quite useful vs traditional A/B testing when there are >4 variations.

- winner threshold (default = 95%) — The confidence level Autotune will use to declare a winner and begin diverting 100% of traffic towards.

- statsig.logEvent(‘click’):Logs a successful click. This combined with getConfig() allows Autotune to compute the click-thru rate.

- Under an A/B/C/D test, 75% of the traffic would have been diverted to inferior variations (vs 42% for Autotune).

Example: For example, anA/B testfor checkout on the Vancouver Olympic Store showed that a single page checkout performed 21.8% better than the multi-step checkout. Large improvements deeper in the funnel require a smaller sample size to test and make every upstream step more effective.


**Key Points:**

- E-commerce is hard.

- 1. Optimizing Conversion Rate

- Crushing the Gloom of Cart Abandonment

- Lighting-up Add-to-Cart Conversions

- 2. Growing Visitors

- Content is Central

- Double Down by Targeting

**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/environments-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments. Example: The solution for this is to create rules explicitly for the Dev and Staging environments (like in the global config example above). It optimizes for engineering efficiency : reducing errors and making troubleshooting faster.


**Key Points:**

- Two philosophies : Per Environment Config vs Global Config

- Wrinkles (and mitigation)

- Example: The solution for this is to create rules explicitly for the Dev and Staging environments (like in the global config example above).

- It optimizes for engineering efficiency : reducing errors and making troubleshooting faster.

**Date:** 2021-10-20T02:14:39.000Z  
**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. Example: Try plugging your pitch into this template:
“[company]helps customers[verb] [business outcome]by[tech capability].”
For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”
### 2. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel.


**Key Points:**

- Sales is all about process.

- 1. Nail your pitch

- 2. Don’t reinvent the wheel

- 3. Warm up your leads

- 4. Be effective, not busy

- Example: Try plugging your pitch into this template:
“[company]helps customers[verb] [business outcome]by[tech capability].”
For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”

### 236. Embrace Overlapping A/B Tests and Avoid the Dangers of Isolating Experiments

**Date:** 2021-10-08T06:44:42.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/embracing-overlapping-a-b-tests-and-the-danger-of-isolating-experiments


**Summary:**  
How to handle simultaneous experiments frequently comes up. Example: For example, one cannot test new ranking algorithm A (vs control) and also new ranking algorithm B (vs control) in overlapping tests. This method maintains experimental power, but can reduce accuracy (as I’ll explain later, this is not a major drawback).


**Key Points:**

- Isolated tests— Users are split into segments, and each user is enrolled in only one experiment. Your experimental power is reduced, but accuracy of results are maintained.

- Microsoft’s Online Controlled Experiments At Scale

- How Google Conducts More experiments

- Can You Run Multiple AB Tests At The Same Time?

- Large Scale Experimentation at Spotify

- Running Multiple A/B Tests at The Same Time: Do’s and Dont’s

- AtStatsig, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting many experimentalists from different backgrounds and experiences.

**Date:** 2021-10-06T00:37:45.000Z  
**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ab-testing-for-dummies


**Summary:**  
Since then, my level of understanding has graduated from preschool to elementary- nice! Example: Let me give you an example- for awhile, Facebook was testing out pimple popping videos to engage more folks on video. A/B testing means we can try out more features and quickly see which ones work.Instead of just holding onto one idea and running with it for 6 months, by progressively rolling out new ideas all the time, companies build better products faster.


**Key Points:**

- This is what I googled on my first day with Statsig.

- Example: Let me give you an example- for awhile, Facebook was testing out pimple popping videos to engage more folks on video.

- A/B testing means we can try out more features and quickly see which ones work.Instead of just holding onto one idea and running with it for 6 months, by progressively rolling out new ideas all the time, companies build better products faster.

**Date:** 2021-09-24T00:26:47.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-conversion-in-e-commerce


**Summary:**  
Today, I want to share an inside look into experimentation at a popular financial services company that offers payment processing services and APIs for e-commerce applications¹. Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience. This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.


**Key Points:**

- How experimentation moves the numbers in a popular payment processing company

- Experimentation is core to product development

- Experimentation with a smaller user base

- Choosing the right metrics

- All in on Experimentation

- Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience.

- This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.

### 243. My Five Favorite Things About Swift

**Date:** 2021-05-11T07:20:26.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/my-five-favorite-things-about-swift


**Summary:**  
I started doing iOS development at Facebook, which only used Objective-C for its iOS apps. Example: For example, instead of concatenating strings like this:
NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;
NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;
NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];
we can now do this:
let firstMsg = “Concatenating strings in Swift “
let secondMsg = “is EAZY”
let fullMsg = firstMsg + secondMsg
### 2. #### Statsigstrives to empower all developers to ship features faster, so naturally one of the first milestones for us was to provide an SDK for iOS development.


**Key Points:**

- optional parameters and labels

- 1. Swift is much more readable

- 2. Swift supports modern language features

- 3. No more header files!

- 4. Some nice quirks that I didn’t know I wanted

- 5. Easy to port to Objective-C

- Example: For example, instead of concatenating strings like this:
NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;
NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;
NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];
we can now do this:
let firstMsg = “Concatenating strings in Swift “
let secondMsg = “is EAZY”

### 244. RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

**Date:** 2021-05-05T05:41:52.000Z  
**Author:** Rodrigo Roim  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ruid-time-travel-safe-distributed-unique-64-bit-ids-generated-in-rust


**Summary:**  
AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration. - Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.


**Key Points:**

- 41 bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- 14 bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- 9 bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

- Defining a millisecond maximum time travel thresholdMMTTT(sometimes shortened asM2T3).

- Comparing the current generation timestampCtwith the previous generation timestampPt. WhenCt < Ct + MMTTT < Pt, RUIDs are generated withPtas the timestamp.

- Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

- Should you use it?

### 1. Profiling Server Core: How we cut memory usage by 85%

**Date:** 2025-10-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Daniel Loomb  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/profiling-server-core-how-we-cut-memory-usage


**Summary:**  
The goal was simple: optimize a single codebase and see the results across every server SDK. #### Server Core v0.2.0
When we first launched Server Core, we hadn't yet invested the time to improve memory.


**Key Points:**

- Our Legacy Statsig Python SDK at version 0.64.0

- Our Server Core Python SDK at version 0.2.0 (before memory optimizations)

- Our Server Core Python SDK at version 0.9.3 (latest optimizations)

- Strings consumed 56 MB.Repeated values like "idType": "userID" appeared thousands of times.

- Repeated values like "idType": "userID" appeared thousands of times.

- DynamicReturnable objects consumed 69 MB.They were often duplicated across experiments and layers.

- They were often duplicated across experiments and layers.

- Makes cloning cheap (critical for when the SDK logs exposures, where strings can be repeated frequently).

### 2. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong: Navigating multiple comparison corrections in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparison-corrections-in-a-b


**Summary:**  
This occurs when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted simultaneously, whether it’s peeking at the data during the experiment, examining several key performance indicators (KPIs), or analyzing different segments of the population. Example: For example, with an alpha of 5% and 5 tests, you would reject the null hypothesis for p-values lower than 0.01, instead of 0.05. Additionally, strict corrections like Bonferroni significantly reduce statistical power.


**Key Points:**

- Rank all p-values in ascending order.

- For each p-value, calculate 𝑖 / 𝑚 * 𝛼, where i is the rank of the p-value (according to step 1) and m is the total number of tests.

- Find the largest rank (k) for which the p-value is smaller than the value calculated in step 2.

- Reject all hypotheses till rank k.

- 1 control group, drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 12.

- 7 treatment groups, sampled from the same distribution as the control (i.e., no true effect).

- 3 treatment groups, each with a true revenue uplift of 2.5% (mean = 102.5).

- The proportion of significant results among the three treatment groups with true effects.

### 3. Experiments with AI in the Creative Process

**Date:** 2025-10-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cat Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experiments-with-ai-creative


**Summary:**  
In-house OOH campaigns are rare opportunities to exercise creativity beyond the usual brand tone. They can be tailored to their context - location, audience, event - and reframe a brand's core narrative. Example: (For example, uploading a picture of a pit stop wheel gun would generate something that looked like a hair dryer.)
Even after getting the generated image "close enough," the resolution was low, edges were messy, and details were off. Ultimately we found that using AI helped us increase ourcreative velocity: the speed at which our ideas could become real and move to execution.


**Key Points:**

- Quickly generate images to communicate concepts

- Create numerous copy variations to expand our brainstorms

- Research contextually relevant information

- Clarify your vision first—creative direction is keyThis is the pivotal point in the creative process where you either use AI creatively or let AI be creative for you.

- Use AI to optimize for AIOnce you've set a clear creative direction, refine your language to work with the specific image generation models you're using.

- Early Phase: Concept Development

- Mid Phase: Fleshing out a direction

- Key learnings for prompting

### 8. How we created count distinct in Statsig Cloud

**Date:** 2025-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Aamodit Acharya  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-we-created-count-distinct-in-statsig-cloud


**Summary:**  
When I joined Statsig, I spent my first week reading through customer requests. Almost immediately, a pattern jumped out to me. Unique artists in the first 7 days.


**Key Points:**

- Distinct artists listened per user

- Distinct SKUs purchased per user

- Distinct search queries issued per user

- Distinct repositories pushed per user

- Distinct merchants paid per user

- Wed: viewed {A}If you summed daily distincts you would get 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.Merging the three sketches yields {A, B, C}, which is 3.

- I kept the core model in Spark SQL and stored each day’s sketch as a base64 string in Parquet on GCS so it can safely move through BigQuery tables when needed.

- On the Spark side, I decode that field back into a native sketch and continue merges and extraction with the Spark UDFs and helpers.

### 9. Sink, swim, or scale: What startups teach us about launching AI

**Date:** 2025-08-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Alexey Komissarouk  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-startups-lessons-learned


**Summary:**  
About the guest author.Alexey Komissarouk is aGrowth Engineering Advisorwho teachesGrowth Engineering on Reforge. Previously, he was the Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Early users, however, complained they “still didn’t know what to do with this thing.”Notion pivotedfrom “AI writes for you” to “AI improves what you’ve already written,” redesigned starter prompts, and saw usage rise as the mental cost of exploration dropped.


**Key Points:**

- Pre‑negotiate burst capacity with vendors (spot GPUs, secondary clouds, reseller credits) so you scale up within minutes without surprise bills.

- Offer a “happy hour” off‑peak tier that absorbs hobby traffic without harming premium latency.

- Replace blank prompt boxes with role‑based starter chips and one‑click examples that autofill.

- Instrument “prompt redo” and “undo” events as frustration signals; run weekly funnel reviews on them.

- Offer an “explain my last prompt” toggle—turning trial‑and‑error into guided learning.

- When financially viable, start with a flat plan that eliminates mental transaction costs; layer in usage-based overages only once users reach actual ceilings.

- Expose “token burn so far” inside the interface, not tucked away in billing dashboards.

- Run price‑sensitivity experiments onengagedcohorts, not top‑of‑funnel sign‑ups; willingness to pay lags perceived mastery.

### 10. Optimizing cloud compute costs with GKE and compute classes

**Date:** 2025-07-25T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-cloud-compute-costs-with-gke-and-compute-classes


**Summary:**  
Anyone who has optimized cloud compute costs knows that spot nodes can significantly reduce your bill. Example: But we found that node weighting alone has significant limitations:
- Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling
Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling
- Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time
Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time
### Detailed real-world example
To showcase why this is problematic here is a detailed example. ### How do you reduce your cloud compute costs without using a third-party vendor?


**Key Points:**

- Loss of Control: You're entrusting third-party providers with your node management, which could risk disrupting your workflows with opaque algorithms

- Cost: These services can significantly add to your operational expenses

- Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling

- Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time

- Pool A: Cheapest spot nodes, high preemption rate (5% per hour)

- Pool B: Moderately priced spot nodes, lower preemption rate (2% per hour)

- Pool C: Non-spot nodes, most expensive, zero preemption

- Initial State: All workloads run on Pool A (100 nodes).

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. Example: Another great example is Notion AI, which writes and summarizes within your existing workspace. Keep response time below 200 ms and uptime above 99.9 %, and you’ve passed.


**Key Points:**

- Google's Geminioutperformed GPT-4 on 30 of 32 benchmarksand beat humans on language understanding tests. Once deployed, it suggestedadding glue to pizzato make cheese stick better.

- Perplexity faced lawsuitsforcreating fake news sectionsand falsely attributing content to real publications.

- Note: We recently launched our Evals product that solves this problem - clickhereto learn more

- Monitor success metrics.These metrics become your real quality benchmarks. The easiest way to do this is with product analytics.

- Watch user sessions.Record user interactions to understand the stories behind metrics - why users drop off, where confusion occurs, when they ignore AI suggestions.

- Ship big changes as A/B tests.Do 50/50 rollouts of what you think will be big wins to quantify the impact. This helps your team build intuition for what actually moves the needle.

- Expand.Ship features to larger and larger groups of users, monitoring success metrics and bad outcomes as you go.

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results? Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

- How to deal with multiple comparisons

- Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.

### 14. Randomization: The ABC’s of A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-06-30T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it? Example: This example underscores the critical importance of random allocation. It may also be influenced by infrastructure constraints (e.g., if the company’s allocation system only supports online assignment) or performance considerations (e.g., offline assignment may reduce runtimes).


**Key Points:**

- (A) Simple Randomization:Randomly assign users into two groups without considering balancing factors.

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

- Simple randomization: just go with the flow

- Seed randomization: Take your best shot

- Stratified randomization: Be a control freak

- ‍Which randomization method should you use?

- 1. Which users are participating in the experiment?

### 15. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift.


**Key Points:**

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

- It is less susceptible to external shocks (holidays, marketing pulses).

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- Use proxies, not your KPIs

- Boost signal and reduce noise with thoughtful statistics

- Covariate adjustment (CUPED & CURE)

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel. By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.


**Key Points:**

- Why test in parallel?

- What should you watch out for?

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel.

- By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.

**Author:** Israel Ben Baruch  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/move-forward-the-a-b-testing-mindset-guide


**Summary:**  
Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time. It sharpens your thinking and helps you act faster if your current test fails.


**Key Points:**

- Be obsessed.You check results more than you should. You run through your funnels again and again. Your head swarms with ideas. You’re not crazy, you’re exactly where you should be.

- Organizational culture.Your mindset needs an organization that supports it - one that encourages people to take risks, experiment, and always push forward.

- Professional expertise.CRO is a craft. Find the people, the content, and the companies to learn from. Apply. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. Most importantly: keep evolving.

- Great tools.Use high-quality, reliable measurement and testing platforms. They’re the foundation of effective testing. No compromises.

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

### 18. Experimentation and AI: 4 trends we’re seeing 

**Date:** 2025-06-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. Example: Example: It has become common for chat interface-based apps (like ChatGPT, Vercel V0, Lovable) to experiment with suggested prompts to help users quickly discover and realize value, which subsequently drives engagement and retention.


**Key Points:**

- Good logging on all the product metrics you care about

- The ability to link these metrics to everything you release

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

- Trend 2: More AI code drives the need for quantitative optimization

- Trend 3: Every engineer is a growth engineer

- Trend 4: Product value comes from your unique context

- Closing thoughts: AI is part of every product

### 19. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. Example: For example, if you were a developer seeing this code, it felt like choosing between the black wire and the red wire to cut if you had a time bomb in front of you:
There was even one time when someone accidentally set production services to connect to ourlatest(dev-stage) Redis instance instead of the correct prod one. It was time to build a tool that would help us move faster and safer.


**Key Points:**

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

- First, a developer pushes changes to a repo (call it Service X).

- Automated regional rollouts, powered by StatsigRelease Pipelines

- Shadow pipeline simulations

- Cost-based VM selection automation

- Highly manual configuration

- Disconnected dependencies

### 20. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. Example: For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes.


**Key Points:**

- the number of units in the control group is relatively small, and

- the denominator is relatively noisy (but still statistically distinct from 0)

- \( Z_{\alpha/2} \) is the critical value associated with the desired confidence level

- \( \mathrm{var}(X_C) \) is the variance of the control group metric values

- \( n_C \) is the number of units in the control group

- \( \overline{X_C} \) is the mean of the control group metric values

### 21. Why data and intuition aren&#39;t enemies

**Date:** 2025-05-30T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Laurel Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-data-and-intuition-arent-enemies


**Summary:**  
I’ve always been excited by the power of data storytelling. Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example. Metrics are often consulted only when something breaks, not when there is an opportunity to improve.


**Key Points:**

- Great products come from intuition guided by data, not intuition versus data.

- The uphill battle for metrics adoption

- Reframing the relationship between data and intuition

- The adaptive nature of good metrics

- Moving forward with adaptive taste

- Finding a data-informed culture at Statsig

- Product manager playbook

- Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example.

### 22. Empowering your team is the future of product leadership

**Date:** 2025-05-28T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. Paradoxically,trying to control everything actually reduces your control over what matters most.


**Key Points:**

- Defining outcomes that matter rather than dictating every task

- Providing context about user needs and business priorities

- Creating frameworks that enable autonomous decision-making

- Trusting your engineers to determine the "how" once they understand the "why"

- The challenge of proving value

- The two paths for product leaders

- The brute force PM

- The force-multiplier leader

### 23. Simulating Bigtable in BigQuery with Type 2 SCD modeling

**Date:** 2025-05-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Example: For example, “How does user behavior on our app change before, during, and after they obtain a premium subscription?”
We also need to store these updates in aversioned mannersince customers often want to observe how user behavior changes over time or with different properties. Bigtable’s write path also comfortably sustains millions of QPS, so cross‑region replication keeps read latency below 10 ms no matter wherever the request originates, letting us replicate it in near real-time.


**Key Points:**

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- User-property updates are generated in one of two ways (in blue). Customers either set up bulk uploads in our web console, or they use our SDKS to log them at run-time.

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

- Then, we have a Dataflow that reads those updates from Bigtable CDC, and streams those to BigQuery in near real-time.

- The current state of the Bigtable:

- The state of the Bigtable at some moment in time:

- How some property has changed over time:

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

### 24. Chasing metrics, not tasks: Why outcome-obsessed PMs win

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. One of my focus areas was improving our customer acquisition funnel.


**Key Points:**

- Misaligned incentives:Measuring success by task completion rather than outcome impact reinforced a culture of checking boxes rather than driving real business results.

- Letting go of sunk costs:When the data shows an initiative isn’t working, cut it – no matter how much time you’ve invested.

- Zooming out regularly:That metric you’ve been optimizing might not be the one that matters most. Don’t miss the forest for the trees.

- My metrics-focused foundation

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- The roadmap is a false comfort

- The buy-in breakthrough

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 25. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- How do you interpret the outcome of a non-inferiority test?

- How do you properly integrate non-inferiority tests into your company's A/B testing process?

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

- Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine.

- In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.

### 26. Fail faster, learn faster: Why &#34;done&#34; beats &#34;perfect&#34; in modern product management

**Date:** 2025-05-20T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. Shipping thin slices lets you take more at-bats, improve your swing, and learn from each attempt.


**Key Points:**

- Create feedback loops to build learnings from users quickly

- Limit the potential downsides if a feature underperforms and course correct

- Build stakeholder confidence by showing visible progress

- Collect real-world feedback that no amount of planning can substitute for

- Build organizational muscle memory for rapid learning

- Create space for high-risk, high-reward ideas that might be killed in a "perfect first time" culture

- Free up resources to pursue more opportunities rather than polishing a single feature

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

### 27. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. Example: For example, let’s say you true north metric is the revenue generated in the next year. Over time, product changes can improve or degrade the quality of prediction that a particular surrogate model produces.


**Key Points:**

- Inputs should be independent of assignment. Assignment to any given experiment group should be random and not correlated to any input to the predictive model.

- Outputs should not exhibit heteroscedasticity. For each predicted value, the prediction and the expected magnitude of the error term should not be correlated.

- Best Practice for ML Engineering

Howie Xu, Chief AI & Innovation Officer at Gen, founder of VMware’s networking division, and AI-focused investor and lecturer at Stanford
From the slow burn of AI adoption to the messy realities of product growth, the conversation was rich with honest takes, timeless lessons, and the kind of hard-won wisdom you only get from people who’ve shipped at scale.


**Key Points:**

- Ami Vora, former CPO of Faire and VP of Product at WhatsApp and Facebook Ads

- Rajeev Rajan, CTO at Atlassian and former VP of Engineering at Facebook and Microsoft

- Howie Xu, Chief AI & Innovation Officer at Gen, founder of VMware’s networking division, and AI-focused investor and lecturer at Stanford

- Ami: At WhatsApp, the focus was on reliability and making the product feel like a utility or physical object. Fewer tests, fewer changes, and a relentless commitment to stability.

- Rajeev: Atlassian steers clear of sweeping UI overhauls in Jira. “It’s like redesigning a car dashboard—you can’t mess with muscle memory.”

- Ami: “Stay on the frontier of learning. It never feels good to be bad at something—but that’s where the learning starts.”

- Rajeev: “Forget the next title. Write the book of your life—what story do you want to tell?”

- Howie: “The new skill is TQ—token quotient. The more you engage with AI tools, the more prepared you’ll be.”

### 31. Continuous promotion for infrastructure with Statsig and Pulumi

**Date:** 2025-04-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics.


**Key Points:**

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

- Deployments that must be paused for manual sign‑off orchange‑management windows

- Initialize the Statsig server SDK at the start of your deployment.

- Get deployment decision from feature flags or dynamic configs.

- Deploy the target resources.

- Approve:Manually green‑light the next phase once metrics look good.

- Pause:Hold the rollout at the current phase to gather more data or schedule windows.

### 32. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. But when CVR improves while retention craters, the illusion breaks.


**Key Points:**

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

- Hidden cost of partial coverage:blind spots compound. Teams over‑index on the few things they do measure, and leadership starts believing an incomplete trend line.

- Integrate feature flags and experiments so every featurecanbe a testby default.

- Align engineering KPIs with metrics impact, not feature launch.

- Sunset legacy code that cannot be instrumented; it taxes every future decision.

- Why enterprises struggle:each domain team owns a slice of data; merging them requires cross‑org agreements and latency‑tolerant pipelines.

- Metrics is the language of the company. Make them clear and transparent with a centralized catalog.

- For experiments, pick a couple of primary metrics and a few guardrail metrics. Try to standardize across similar experiments.

### 33. Release pipelines: Safer, staged rollouts across your infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-04-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/release-pipelines


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we believe you can move fastwithoutbreaking things. Your 1% of users could be distributed across hundreds of clusters, and if this change causes unexpected behavior in production, it could bring down your entire infrastructure stack, as every server experiences the increased CPU and memory usage.


**Key Points:**

- Roll out changes environment by environment (dev → staging → prod)

- Target specific infrastructure segments within environments (prod-us-west → prod-us-east → prod-eu)

- Control progression between stages with time intervals or manual approvals

- Monitor each stage before proceeding to the next

- Roll back instantly if issues arise at any stage

- Catch issues early, before they affect a large portion of your infrastructure

- Prevent cascading failuresacross your entire system, ensuring higher uptime

- Validate changes in real production environmentswith minimal risk

### 34. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Example: Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:
Figure 3:A P95 performance graph comparing our legacy Node SDK (green) and Node Core SDK (blue) runtime for a gate check. With Rust's memory safety, performance, concurrency, and zero-cost abstractions, the improvements to actual evaluation time have been huge enough to outweigh the binding costs.


**Key Points:**

- pyo3 (Python):Getting started - PyO3 user guide

- napi-rs (Node):Getting started – NAPI-RS

- jni-rs (Java):GitHub - jni-rs/jni-rs: Rust bindings to the Java Native Interface

- ruslter (Elixir):GitHub - rusterlium/rustler: Safe Rust bridge for creating Erlang NIF functions

- What we learned

- Join the Slack community

### 35. The rise of experimentation as the industry standard

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. Example: One notable example is the16-month TV advertising experimentAmazon ran in a few markets, which showed that TV ads delivered only a modest sales bump. In the new model we grow bylearning faster—hundreds of tiny, controlled bets that compound.


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- Experimenting with the length of forms to mitigate user dropoffs

- Using 20% of an email audience to suss out the best email subject line and sending it to the remaining 80%

- Testingvirtually anythingin a focus group

- Implementing customer surveys to gauge reactions to potential upcoming initiatives

- Jeff Bezos on the importance of experimentation

- A booming market for experimentation platforms like Statsig

- Examples of high-impact experiments

### 36. Digital marketing attribution models: A tech survey

**Date:** 2025-04-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. Example: Early versions were still rule-based (for example, splitting credit evenly or favoring the first and last touches). MMM emerged in the 1950s (though it rose to popularity in the 1980s) as a top-down approach that uses aggregate data and statistical regression to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel to sales [1].


**Key Points:**

- Shapley Value Attribution

- Algorithmic/Statistical Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ML)

- Incrementality Testing and Lift Models

- Causal Inference-Based Multi-Channel Attribution

- Customer Journey-based Deep Learning Models

- Captures sequential nature of journeys.

- Explains results via the “If we remove channel X, how many conversions are lost?” logic, which is intuitive.

- More nuanced than any single-position rule; channels that primarily appear in converting paths get more credit.

### 37. ⚠️ Top secret hackathon projects from Q1 2025

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hackathon-projects-q1-2025


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, Hackathons are quarterly events where employees set aside their usual work to build anything they want—whether it’s an experimental feature, a wild automation, or a just-for-fun internal tool. Example: In one example, the team asked it to locate stale gates and remove them. ## 📈 Analytics and experimentation
Tools that expand Statsig’s experimentation and data analysis capabilities, or improve how results are presented and explored.

### 38. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Example: For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:
On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of. We also have tools likeCUPEDthat will control for values that we can see before the experiment, avoiding the worst of the bias and making your experiments run faster.


**Key Points:**

- You have to choose experiments that can be applied across pages, and that you'd expect to have a similar impact on each of the pages you'd apply it to.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

- Image optimizations,such as enabling lazy loading across all pages.

- Multimedia enhancements,like adding audio versions of blog posts to see if this boosts engagement or traffic.

- Challenges of SEO A/B testing

- Designing your experiment

- Sidecar no-code A/B testing

- The right tools for the job

### 39. How to accurately test statistical significance

**Date:** 2025-04-12T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/steps-to-accurately-test-statistical-significance


**Summary:**  
This is where the concept of statistical significance comes into play, helping you make confident choices based on solid data. Example: For example, when testing if a new feature increases user engagement, the null hypothesis would be that engagement remains unchanged. For example, when testing if a new feature increases user engagement, the null hypothesis would be that engagement remains unchanged.


**Key Points:**

- Avoid making decisions based on false positives or random noise

- Identify genuine patterns and relationships that can inform strategic choices

- Allocate resources and investments towards initiatives with proven impact

- Minimize the risk of costly mistakes or missed opportunities

- Clearly define your null and alternative hypotheses based on the question you're investigating

- Select an α that balances the risks ofType I and Type II errorsfor your specific context

- Ensure your sample size is adequate to detect meaningful differences at your chosen α

- A p-value does not indicate the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false. It only measures the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis were true.

### 40. Why A/B testing is ultimately qualitative

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-ab-testing-is-ultimately-qualitative


**Summary:**  
People with diverse perspectives have to debate options in a room, weighing pros and cons between multiple (sometimes conflicting) objectives, many of which can't be captured in a single metric.


**Key Points:**

- Start with a purpose: Don’t run experiments without a well-considered hypothesis. Don't just think aboutwhatmetrics will move, think aboutwhythey might move.

- Invite broader feedback: Listen to stakeholders who might have non-quantitative insights. They may spot factors that algorithms or dashboards might miss.

- Frame decisions as trade-offs: A/B tests often reveal gains in one metric at the expense of another. Bring in qualitative judgments about which trade-offs matter most.

- Understanding the bigger picture

- The limitations of data and the role of expert judgment

### 41. Introducing CURE: Smarter regression, faster experiments

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/announcing-cure


**Summary:**  
Statsig is excited to announce that we’re moving out of beta testing and into full production launch for CURE - an extension of CUPED - which allows users to add arbitrary covariate data to regression adjustment in their experiments, reducing variance even further than existing CUPED implementations. Example: For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results. For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED: Controlled [Experiment] Using Pre-Experiment Data

- CURE: [Variance] Control Using Regression Estimates

- If you have a predictive model of future behaviors, you can easilyuse that as a covariate in CURE(like Doordash’s CUPAC)

- If you want to provide additional signal to the standard CUPAC approach, you canpick and choose different user attributes or behaviorsto add to the regression

- CURE brings powerful, flexible regression adjustment to every Statsig experiment.

### 45. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. Example: For example, a treatment’s impact on revenue might be most noticeable among high-spending players, where behavioral changes are more pronounced. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects.


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type II error (β):The probability of failing to detect a true improvement when one exists.

- Set the winsorization threshold (X%):In A/B testing, common choices are 1% or 0.1%, depending on the required adjustment and sample size.

- Replace extreme values:Values beyond these thresholds are capped at the corresponding percentile values.

- Why outliers can be harmful

- How to identify outliers

- What to do with outliers

- Time for winsorization!

### 47. Designing controlled experiments to test correlated metrics

**Date:** 2025-03-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/designing-controlled-experiments-correlated-metrics


**Summary:**  
Correlationoccurs when there is a relationship between the values of some variable with the values of some other bariable. total spend in the first 7 days a user is active may be predictive of total spend in the following 6 months
Surrogate metrics, metrics that are a leading indicator or another metric - e.g.


**Key Points:**

### 48. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Example: For example, if you’re trying out a new shipping policy, you can apply it in one state while leaving a similar region as control. ### 3.Phased Rollouts
A phased rollout gradually increases the share of users or clusters that see a new feature (e.g., 1% to 10% to 50%), always using random assignment at each step.


**Key Points:**

- Ensure consistent assignment: If you want a single user to see the same variant as both a buyer and a seller, factor that into your randomization logic.

### 49. What no one tells you about feature flags and messy code

**Date:** 2025-03-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others. Example: Let's walk through an example. For example, if the flag is being used to slowly roll out a new checkout experience, and you're aiming for 100% rollout by the end of the month, create a “Removeff_new_checkout” ticket with a due date 30–45 days after full rollout.


**Key Points:**

- [ ] Remove all `if/else` conditions using `ff_new_checkout`

- [ ] Delete the flag from Statsig’s dashboard (mark as deprecated first)

- [ ] Remove related experiment code or tracking if applicable

- [ ] Update documentation or `FLAGS.md` if needed

- [ ] Confirmation that no users are on the legacy flow

- [ ] No recent rollbacks in the past 14 days

- When should this flag be removed?

- Who’s responsible for removing it?

### 50. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. - Tightening the Confidence (Credible) Interval:Alternatively, one can choose a narrower prior that reduces uncertainty in the posterior distribution.


**Key Points:**

- The choice of priors can strongly influence the resulting posterior estimates, requiring careful calibration to avoid unintentionally skewing the analysis.

- Neither type of informed Bayesian approach is “wrong” in principle, but the first introduces a greater risk of data manipulation, while the second can slow down decision-making.

- In many cases, the second approach is effectively equivalent to applying FDR-type frequentist adjustments and often yields the same outcomes, just framed in Bayesian terms.

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

### 51. Why buying an experimentation platform makes more sense than building one

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/buying-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
“Building your own experimentation platform made a lot of sense… five years ago,” says our customer Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager - Core ML at Whatnot, who previously worked on DoorDash’s in-house platform. Example: For example, over the past year we’ve shipped several advanced capabilities that you won’t find in a typical experimentation platform:
- Stats methodologies such as stratified sampling, differential impact detection, interaction detection, Benjamini Hochberg procedure etc. Over the past few years, several companies have moved away from in-house experimentation tooling and turned to Statsig to scale their experimentation cultures.Notionincreased their experimentation velocity by 30x within a year.Limewent from limited testing to experimenting on every change before rolling it out.


**Key Points:**

- Server & client-side SDKsfor seamless experimentation across all surfaces without impacting performance

- Data logging, ingestion and processing servicesand/or integration with your data warehouse

- Randomization functionsfor accurate user allocations in different scenarios

- Experiment result computationsincluding metric lifts, p-values, confidence intervals, and other statistical calculations

- Automated checks(like power analysis, balanced exposures) to ensure experiments are properly set up and issues are identified proactively

- Statistical correctionsto account for outliers, pre-experimental bias, and differential impact, etc. to provide trustworthy results

- Variance reduction(CUPED, winsorization)

- Experimentation techniqueslike sequential testing, switchback testing, geo-based tests etc.

**Date:** 2025-03-06T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/automating-bigquery-load-jobs-gcs


**Summary:**  
As our data needs evolved, we created a flexible and dynamic ingestion solution. Example: Example:
## Orchestrating workflows
We use an orchestrator configured to trigger our Python ingestion script periodically, following a cron-like schedule. Time-based bucketing of files
We organize incoming data into discrete time buckets (e.g., every 1,000 seconds).


**Key Points:**

- Automatically detect and ingest data into new tables dynamically.

- Group files into time-based buckets for organized ingestion.

- Reliably track ingestion jobs, accounting for potential delays in status reporting.

- BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS:for historical job statuses and to identify completed or failed jobs.

- MongoDB:for tracking pending and initiated jobs to mitigate delays in BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA updates.

- bq_load_source_bucket_name: Indicates the originating bucket for the load job.

- bq_load_dest_table_name: Indicates the destination table for the load job.

- bq_load_bucket_timestamp: Indicates the specific time bucket processed.

### 55. KPI traps: How &#34;successful&#34; experiments can still be failures

**Date:** 2025-03-05T00:02-08:00  
**Author:** Lin Jia  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kpi-traps-successful-experiments-can-fail


**Summary:**  
You set up the experiment cautiously, collected data diligently, and celebrated when it achieved statistical significance for your KPI. Example: For example, a company notices that customer service calls are taking too long. When they run a two-week experiment to measure the impact, they find that DAU increases as more users return to the app.


**Key Points:**

- Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever.

- Success on paper, but failure in practice

- False positive risk

- False positive risk given the success rate, p-value threshold of 0.025 (successes only), and 80% power

### 59. Beyond prompts: A data-driven approach to LLM optimization

**Date:** 2025-03-04T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Anna Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/llm-optimization-online-experimentation


**Summary:**  
This article presents a systematic framework for online A/B testing of LLM applications, focusing onprompt engineering, model selection, and temperature tuning. Example: ## Experiment design and statistical rigor
### Hypothesis and goal
Define a measurable hypothesis: e.g., “Adding an example to the prompt will increase correct answer rates by 5%.” This clarity guides your metrics and success criteria. By isolating and experimenting with specific factors, teams can generate tangible improvements in performance, user engagement, and cost-efficiency.


**Key Points:**

- Improve performance: Validate hypothesis-driven changes (like new prompts) directly with real users.

- Reduce costs: Pinpoint “good enough” model variants or narrower context windows that maintain quality while lowering expenses.

- Boost engagement: Track user behaviors such as conversation length, retention, or click-through rates to ensure AI experiences resonate with users.

- Randomized user allocation: Users are split—often 50/50—so each group experiences only one variant. Randomization ensures a fair comparison.

- Single variable isolation: If testing a new prompt, keep the model and temperature consistent across both variants to attribute outcome differences to prompt changes.

- A different base model (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5).

- A refined prompt with new instructions or examples.

- Altered parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p).

### 60. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Vercel Native Integration

**Date:** 2025-02-27T07:00-12:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-vercel-native-integration


**Summary:**  
Modern web development depends on a seamless experience for users and developers. Performant, fast, and reliable websites are table stakes for users in 2025.At the same time, websites and applications are becoming increasingly complex, with more features, integrations, and components contributing to the user experience. Example: For example, if you're introducing a new navigation layout, you can first enable the flag for internal users, gather feedback, and then gradually roll it out to production—all without pushing a new deployment. No developer wants to manage extra configurations, third-party dashboards, or custom integrations, and no user wants to see a page flicker on load, or experience another 100ms wait until the page renders.


**Key Points:**

- Create and manage feature flagsto control your releases

- Run experimentsto test changes and measure impact

- Gain access to Analytics, Session Replay, and other Statsig product toolsthat don’t exist natively in your Vercel dashboard

- Use Statsig’s SDKs and Edge Config syncingfor low-latency performance without additional setup

- Install the integration:Find Statsig in the Vercel Marketplace and complete the quick setup flow

- Choose a billing plan:Both plans offer generous limits: theFree tierincludes 2M events/month, while thePro tierprovides 5M events/month for just $150

- Install Statsig and connect your Statsig project: Link your Statsig project to Vercel to sync feature flags, experiments, settings, permissions, etc.

- Initialize with Vercel’s Flags SDK or Statsig's SDK:We recommend using Vercel's Flags SDK for Next.js and SvelteKit projects; use Statsig’s SDK for all other projects

### 61. How to think about the relationship between correlation and causation

**Date:** 2025-02-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/correlation-vs-causation-guide


**Summary:**  
Yet, people still confuse correlation with causation all the time. Example: For example, this upsell that claims “4x” profile views as promised by LinkedIn Premium is definitely more correlation than causation. The trouble starts when people try to lock down a specific metric or target, like the famous claim thatadding more than 10 friends in 7 days is the key to Facebook’s engagement.


**Key Points:**

- Spot most cases of confusionbetween correlation and causation and form a clear idea of where the errors might come from.

- Grasp the essence of causal inference modelsbased on observed data. You’ll see exactly when their assumptions hold and when they don’t.

- Fifteen-year-old children who took the pill grew an average of 3 inches in one year.

- In the same schools, fifteen-year-old children who didnottake the pill grew an average of 2 inches in one year.

- Families with more money can afford the pill and give their kids better nutrition.

- Families who choose the pill care more about healthy growth and use other measures.

- Families who opt for the pill have shorter kids to begin with, so they show more “catch-up” growth.

- Most of us have heard the phrase “correlation isn’t causation.”

**Author:** Michael Makris  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-are-guardrail-metrics-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Your team designed the feature well, you set ambitious business targets, you built the feature well, and designed a solid A/B test to measure the results. Example: For example, if you're testing a new user interface, your primary metric might be the click-through rate on a feature button. While you aim to improve specific aspects of your product through A/B testing, you shouldn’t compromise on the overall system and business health.


**Key Points:**

- Ensuring that gains in one area do not cause losses in another

- Providing a holistic view of the impact of your tests

- Interactions with other features

- Envision the following:

- Introduction to guardrail metrics in A/B testing

### 64. How Statsig uses query-level experiments to speed up Metrics Explorer

**Date:** 2025-02-20T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Nicole Smith  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/query-level-experiments-metrics-explorer


**Summary:**  
Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. However, when we’re making performance improvements to Metrics Explorer queries, we’re less concerned with a stable user experience for experimentation purposes, and more concerned with making them faster in every scenario.


**Key Points:**

- More funnel steps: When there are more funnel steps, the size of the temp table or CTE in question is more likely to be larger.

- Grouping by a field: This tends to make subsequent steps in the query more expensive, so having using a temp table may be more efficient when a group by is in place.

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

- The implementation

- Handling assignment

- Query event telemetry

### 67. Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics: Not a big deal?

**Date:** 2025-02-11T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-vs-frequentist-statistics


**Summary:**  
One common area of confusion and heated debate is the difference betweenBayesian and Frequentist approaches. In theory, they offer several advantages:
- Faster, more accurate decision-making
Faster, more accurate decision-making
- The ability to leverage past information
The ability to leverage past information
- A structured way to debate underlying assumptions
A structured way to debate underlying assumptions
Because of these benefits, some advocate for their adoption including data scientists at companies like Amazon and Netflix (ref).


**Key Points:**

- The unknown is fixed:Thetrueaverage height of adults in your city isn't changing while you're analyzing your data. It's a fixed, albeit unknown, number.

- Randomness is in the data:The randomness comes fromwhichpeople you happen to sample. If you repeated your survey many times, you'd get slightly different results each time.

- Frequentists:Focus on the long-run frequency of events. Probability is about how often something would happen if you repeated the experiment many times.

- Bayesians:Focus on the degree of belief or certainty about an unknown. Probability is a measure of how likely something is, given your current knowledge.

- Large samples:When you have a lot of data, Bayesian and Frequentist approaches tend to give very similar results. The data overwhelms any prior beliefs in the Bayesian approach.

- A Frequentist might see if a 95% confidence interval for the difference in conversion rates excludes zero.

- A Bayesian might see if a 95% credible interval for the difference lies entirely above zero.

- In most cases, they'll reach the same conclusion about which version is better.

### 75. Settings 2.0: Keeping up with a scaling product

**Date:** 2025-01-29T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Cynthia Xin  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/settings-page-design-2025


**Summary:**  
Over the past few years, Statsig has scaled significantly, adding multiple products and features to our platform. Example: In Settings 1.0, the left-side navigation menu was essentially broken down into "project" and "organization."
If users wanted to edit settings for a feature gate, for example, they needed to remember which settings were considered project settings versus organization settings, often resulting in users having to navigate different tabs just to track down one toggle. ### UI simplification
We updated the UI in Settings 2.0 to improve usability while adhering toour latest design system, Pluto.


**Key Points:**

- Members > Select a Team > Edit Team Settings

- Organization Info > Gate Settings

- Settings 2.0 introduces a main navigation and a sub-navigation

- Users can easily switch between Team, Project, and Organization settings for product features by using the sub-navigation

- We recently embarked on a journey to make our Settings page even better.

- Intuitive navigation (Product first, permission level second)

- Consolidating members, teams, and roles

- UI simplification

### 76. Stratified sampling in A/B Tests

**Date:** 2025-01-28T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/stratified-sampling-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Stratified sampling might just be the tool you need to bring clarity and precision to yourA/B testing efforts. Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison. This approach not only improves the quality of your data but also deepens your understanding of how different segments interact with your product.


**Key Points:**

- Identify key covariates: Look at past data to see which demographics or behaviors link closely with the changes you’re testing.

- Categorize your users: Group them by these identified covariates. This ensures each category is tested.

- Imagine you're running experiments to fine-tune your product, but your results swing wildly in every experiment you run.

- Introduction to stratified sampling in A/B testing

- Designing stratified samples for A/B tests

- Implementing stratified sampling in A/B tests

- Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison.

### 77. The ultimate guide to building an internal feature flagging system

**Date:** 2025-01-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
“Why do people pay for this?”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions. Example: You’re also likely to find some synergies in the code you write across these two services - for example, the service that provides evaluated flag values to clients can borrow logic from the code that evaluates rulesets on your servers, provided they’re written in the same language. - Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?


**Key Points:**

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

- Handle targeting on any user trait, like app version, country, IP address, etc.?

- Have extremely high uptime?

- test a feature in production (by “gating” it to only employees/ beta testers)

- rollout a feature to only certain geographies (by “gating” on user countries)

- run an A/B test (by gating a feature to a random 50% of userIDs)

- Or Run acanary release(release a feature to a random 10% of userIDs, to check that it doesn’t break anything)

### 78. Understanding (and reducing) variance and standard deviation

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:01-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-and-reducing-variance-and-standard-deviation


**Summary:**  
But uncertainty is an inevitability, and it's useful to be able to quantify it. Example: For example, if the standard deviation in our a/b test was close to infinity,anyobservation would be reasonably likely to occur by chance . - If we take a population of 10000 users, split them into even groups, and give half a treatment and half a placebo, we can use standard deviation to evaluate if the treatment did anything.


**Key Points:**

- Assume there is no treatment effect

- Measure our outcome metric

- Calculate the standard deviations of the populations’ metric, and the difference in mean metric values between the two groups

- Calculate the probability of observing that difference in means, given the standard deviation/spread of the population metric

- Variance is the average of squared differences from the mean. For each observation, we subtract the mean, multiply the result by itself, and then add all of those values up

- Standard deviation is the square root of the variance in the population

- Standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of observations

- Variance and standard deviation (MIT lecture)

### 79. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. Example: For example, if most control exposures come from the US while the test group is evenly split between EU and US, the issue might be linked to the SDK in the EU release. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users.


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Why it’s important

- Our new debugging capabilities

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, if most control exposures come from the US while the test group is evenly split between EU and US, the issue might be linked to the SDK in the EU release.

### 80. Detecting interaction effects of concurrent experiments

**Date:** 2025-01-13T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Kane Luo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/interaction-effect-detection


**Summary:**  
To accelerate experimentation, medium to large companies run hundreds of A/B tests simultaneously, aiming to isolate and measure the impact of each change, also known as the "main effect."
However, when multiple tests target the same area of your product, they can influence one another, resulting in either overestimation or underestimation of metric changes. Example: For example, to understand the effect of dark mode without the transition animation, you would compare group C to group A using a standard two-sample t-test. This expands the UI compatibility and aims to improve retention.


**Key Points:**

- Relaunch the same experimentsto a mutually exclusive audience. This is especially useful if you need more statistical power particularly on secondary metrics.

- Conduct manual statistical testsand determine which one of the two features to ship.

- If the interaction is synergistic, you candouble down on the combined experience, by either launching a new test or analyzing group A and D.

- Rework the experienceto make the feature compatible.

- Statsig now offersinteraction effect detectionto uncover the hidden effects of experiments on each other.

- Scenario: Dark mode gone wrong

- How do we diagnose it?

- My experiments are interacting—now what?

### 82. How to report test results

**Date:** 2025-01-02T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-report-test-results


**Summary:**  
Now comes the critical moment—communicating your insights to your company’s stakeholders. Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups. Analysts may prematurely generalize sample results to the population, leading to overly definitive claims such as, “This feature will increase revenue by 10%” or “The conversion rate in the new version improved by 5%.”
How to get it right: When communicating test results, it’s crucial to remember that your data reflects what happens in your sample and may not precisely represent the population.


**Key Points:**

- Secondary KPIs: For secondary KPIs, summarize the results visually or in a table that includes the uplift, the boundaries of the confidence interval, and the p-value.

- 1. Overstating certainty

- 2. Confusing Test Settings with Test Results

- 3. Misinterpreting p-values

- 4. Misinterpreting confidence interval

- 5. Ignoring external validity

- An example: Report of test’s results

- Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups.

### 85. Key problems in D2C that experimentation solves

**Date:** 2025-01-01T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/key-problems-in-d2c-that-experimentation-solves


**Summary:**  
“Half your ideas will fail… you need to verify and tweak your ideas until they actually deliver value for the customer.”
– Wyatt Thompson, Dollar Shave Club
## Why D2C brands face unique challenges
Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands thrive by forging direct relationships with customers—yet this also makes them vulnerable to every friction point along the user journey. Example: For example, small tweaks to the timing or format of promotional emails can reduce churn and encourage repeat purchases within 28 days. keyword-based) or surface trending bundles (“Complete the look”) to see which approach not only increases product visibility but also boosts average order value.


**Key Points:**

- For direct-to-consumer brands, data-driven testing is the real game-changer.

- Why D2C brands face unique challenges

### 86. One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/one-tailed-vs-two-tailed-tests


**Summary:**  
If your answer is no—or if you’re not even sure what this means—then this blog is for you! Example: Reviewing the previous graph can help illustrate this: for example, a result in the left tail might be significant under a two-tailed hypothesis but not under a right one-tailed hypothesis. Note that the purple area is larger for the one-tailed hypothesis, compared to the two-tailed hypothesis:
In practice, to maintain the desired power level, we compensate for the reduced power of a two-tailed hypothesis by increasing the sample size (Increasing sample size raises power, though the mechanics of this can be a topic for a separate article).


**Key Points:**

- One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Hypothesis Testing: Understanding the Difference

- Why does it make a difference?

- How to decide between one-tailed and two-tailed hypothesis?

- Get started now!

### 87. When allocation point and exposure point differ

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/when-allocation-point-and-exposure-point-differ


**Summary:**  
Since this feature isn’t visible when the page loads, users in the test group might leave before scrolling down to see it. Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not. If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.


**Key Points:**

- Why does it happen?

- Why does it matter?

- What should you do?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not.

- If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.

### 89. You don&#39;t need large sample sizes to run A/B tests

**Date:** 2024-12-12T03:15+00:00  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/you-dont-need-large-sample-sizes-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Yet many small and medium-sized companies aren’t running A/B Tests. Example: Google routinely runs large search tests on a massive scale, for example 100,000,000 users where a+0.1% effect on topline metrics is a big win. A/B testing is a pillar of data-driven product development irrespective of the product’s size
### Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing
Startup companies have a major advantage in experimentation:huge potential and upside.Startups don’t play the micro-optimization game; they don’t care about a +0.2% increase in click-through rates.

### 94. It’s normal not to be normal(ly distributed): what to do when data is not normally distributed

**Date:** 2024-10-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-to-do-when-data-is-not-normally-distributed


**Summary:**  
Gosset wanted to estimate the quality of the company’s beer, but was concerned that existing statistical methods would be unreliable due to a small sample size. Example: A familiar example is election polling: statisticians want to predict the outcome for all voters but must rely on a sample of survey responses. Key statistical principles, such as the Central Limit Theorem and Slutsky’s Theorem, show that as the sample size increases, the t statistic converges toward a normal distribution.


**Key Points:**

- Normal distribution: the KPI follows a normal distribution.

- Non-normal distribution: the KPI has a non-normal distribution.

- William Sealy Gosset, a former Head Brewer at Guinness Brewery, had a problem.

- Why do we need the normality assumption?

- The normality assumption with large sample sizes

- So, t-test it is?

- Example: A familiar example is election polling: statisticians want to predict the outcome for all voters but must rely on a sample of survey responses.

- Key statistical principles, such as the Central Limit Theorem and Slutsky’s Theorem, show that as the sample size increases, the t statistic converges toward a normal distribution.

### 97. Feature rollouts: How Instagram left me behind

**Date:** 2024-10-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-rollouts-examples


**Summary:**  
Instagram was becoming the primary medium for keeping tabs on friends and influencers alike—perceiving the world through their iPhone lenses, in a way. Example: Take Spotify Wrapped, for example. I’m not sure if it was always meant to be a temporary feature, or if it simply didn’t increase the metrics that Meta had hoped.


**Key Points:**

- Just got fired from my job:Thankful🌸

- Looking for carpenter recommendations:Thankful🌸

- A compilation of Mark Zuckerberg talking about barbecue sauce:Thankful🌸

- This thankful react thing needs to stop:Thankful🌸

- Tag Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post

- Sign up for my random newsletter

### 98. How A/B testing platforms make data science more interesting

**Date:** 2024-10-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-ab-testing-platforms-make-data-science-more-interesting


**Summary:**  
A/B testing platforms have become highly efficient, automating much of the mundane work involved in setting up, calculating, and reporting on experiments. Example: "An engineer that improves server performance by ten milliseconds more than pays for his or her fully loaded annual costs."
Illustrating the tangible impact of small improvements, Kohavi shared this powerful example. ## Excerpts
"Most experiments fail to improve the metrics they were designed to improve."
Kohavi highlighted a counterintuitive reality: the majority of experiments don't yield the expected positive results.


**Key Points:**

- What’s the current state of experimentation automation since the release of the Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (the "Hippo" book)?

- How does this automation impact the role of data scientists?

- What should data scientists focus on moving forward?

- How can we secure leadership buy-in for experimentation efforts?

- Over the past few years, the data science landscape has fundamentally changed.

- My questions to Ronny:

- Three takeaways

- Experimentation automation benefits data scientists both directly and indirectly

### 100. Introducing experimental meta-analysis and the knowledge base

**Date:** 2024-10-09T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimental-meta-analysis-and-knowledge-base


**Summary:**  
Over the past three years, we’ve seen several companies significantly scale their experimentation culture, often increasing their experimentation velocity by 10-30x within a year. Example: For example, if you’ve spent a quarter testing ways to optimize product recommendations in your e-commerce app, an individual experiment might guide a ship decision. Whatnot hit a run rate of 400 experiments last year,Notion scaled from single-digit to hundreds per quarter,Rec Room went from nearly zero to 150 experimentsin their first year with Statsig, andLime started testing every change they roll out.


**Key Points:**

- What experiments are running now?

- When are they expected to end?

- What % of experiments ship Control vs Test?

- What is the typical duration?

- Do experiments run for their planned duration or much longer or shorter?

- Do experiments impact key business metrics or only shallow or team-level metrics?

- How much do they impact key business metrics?

- The value of experimentation compounds as you run more experiments.

### 108. Why you should &#34;accept&#34; the null hypothesis when hypothesis testing

**Date:** 2024-09-25T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-accept-null


**Summary:**  
You can only fail to reject it!” is widely circulated but fundamentally flawed.


**Key Points:**

- Many people mistakenly interpret "accepting" the null as "proving" it, which is incorrect.

- Null and alternative hypotheses treated symmetrically:Both (H_0) and (H_1) are explicitly defined, and tests are designed to decide between them based on the data.

- Fisher:The alternative hypothesis is often implicit or not formally specified. The focus is on assessing evidence against (H_0).

- Neyman-Pearson:The alternative hypothesis ((H_1)) is explicitly defined, and tests are constructed to distinguish between (H_0) and (H_1).

- Fisher:Emphasizes measuring evidence against (H_0) without necessarily making a final decision.

- Neyman-Pearson:Emphasizes making a decision between (H_0) and (H_1), incorporating the long-run frequencies of errors.

- Fisher's Null Hypothesis:A unique, specific hypothesis tested to see if there is significant evidence against it, using p-values as a measure of evidence.

### 109. How much does a feature flag platform cost?

**Date:** 2024-09-23T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/comparing-feature-flag-platform-costs


**Summary:**  
To simplify the process, we’ve put togethera spreadsheet comparing pricing, complete with all the formulas we used and any assumptions we made.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig offers the lowest pricing across all usage levels, with free gates for non-analytics use cases (i.e., if a gate is used for an A/B test).

- Launch Darkly’s cost for client-side SDKs reachesthe highest levels across all platformsafter ~100k MAU.

- PostHog client-side SDK costs stand as the second cheapestacross feature flag platforms while still racking uphundreds of dollars for usage over 1M requests.

- The assumption of 20 sessions per MAU is made on the basis that each active user is assumed to have 20 unique sessions each month.

- One request per session is used, given a standard 1:1 ratio for requests and sessions.

- 20 gates instrumented per MAU made on the assumption of using 20 gates in a given product.

- 50% of gates checked each session is used as a benchmark on the basis of users only triggering half of the gates in a given session.

- One context (client-side users, devices, or organizations that encounter feature flags in a product within a month) per MAU given the close definition of the two.

### 110. Optimizing config propagation time with target apps

**Date:** 2024-09-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sam Miller  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-config-propagation-time-with-target-apps


**Summary:**  
Propagation latency is defined as the time it takes for a change made in the Console to be reflected by the config checks you issue on your frontend or backend systems with our SDKs. Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps.


**Key Points:**

- Performance: By filtering out irrelevant configurations, the payload sent to each SDK instance is smaller, leading to faster initialization times and lower memory usage

- At Statsig, we’re constantly finding ways to drive down what we call config propagation latency.

- What are target apps?

- Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps.

### 113. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Example: Funnels allow you to measure complex relationships with a higher degree of clarity.For example, you see revenue flatten, but product page views are going up. If you care about improving your checkout flow for products, tracking this data at a session level is more powerful, measuring (successes / tries) instead of (successful users / users who tried)
Consider when a user vs.


**Key Points:**

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- Statistical rigor:Make sure funnel conversions have the delta method applied and have sound practices for ordinal logic.

- Ordered events:For funnels to be really useful, you should be able to specify that users do events in a specific sequence over time.

- Multiple-step funnels:Two-step funnels can be useful, but the ability to add intermediate steps as needed for richer understanding is critical.

- Step-level and overall conversion changes:This is how you can identifywheredrop-offs happen.

- Calculation windows:Being able to specify the maximum duration a user has to finish a funnel is critical to running longer experiments.

### 114. CUPED Explained

**Date:** 2024-09-15T00:00-05:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped


**Summary:**  
MeaningControlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data, CUPED is frequently cited as—and used as—one of the most powerful algorithmic tools for increasing the speed and accuracy of experimentation programs. Example: In the example below, it’s pretty obvious that the difference in the groupsbeforethe test would make the results extremely skewed:
You might note that you can see that the weighted runners’ times went up, and the unweighted runners’ times went down. In this article, we’ll:
- Cover the background of CUPED
Cover the background of CUPED
- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
## What CUPED solves:
As an experiment matures and hits its target date for readout, it’s not uncommon to see a result that seems to beonly barelyoutside the range where it would be treated as statistical


**Key Points:**

- Cover the background of CUPED

- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED

- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments

- The effect size in our T-test (the delta between test and control) is exactly the same as the “test” variable’s coefficient in the OLS regression.

- The standard error for the coefficient is the same as the standard error for our T-test.

- The p-value for the “test” variable coefficient is the same as for our t-test!

- Our p-value goes from 0.116 to 0.000 because of the decreased Standard Error. The result, which was previously not statistically significant, is now clearly significant.

- Multiply the pre-experiment population mean byθand add it to each user’s result

**Date:** 2024-09-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Morgan Scalzo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-experimentation-infrastructure-and-culture-ronny-kohavi


**Summary:**  
We recently hosted a virtual meetup featuring Allon Korem, CEO ofBell, and Ronny Kohavi, awidely respected thought leaderand expert in experimentation. Example: For example, a p-value of 0.01 does not mean there is a 99% chance of success. - Experimentation culture: Establishing an organizational culture that embraces experimentation is vital for continuous growth and improvement.


**Key Points:**

- Case study: Only 12% of 1,000 experiments succeeded, illustrating the harsh reality that many organizations must accept—a high failure rate is normal.

- Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches: They covered the differences between these two statistical approaches and their applications in experimentation.

- A/A tests as best practice: RunningA/A testsis strongly recommended to validate experimentation setups and ensure the reliability of testing infrastructure.

- Asymmetric allocation: This approach can provide advantages to the larger group in an experiment, optimizing for specific outcomes.

- You can always learn something from people with lots of experience.

- Key insights from Ronny Kohavi

- Should every organization aim for "fly" in every category?

- Discussion on failures

### 117. How Meta made me a big-time A/B testing advocate

**Date:** 2024-09-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/meta-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
I wanted to show my data scientist audience how powerful Deltoid is, yet was prohibited from doing so as it’s an internal tool. Example: For example, inan earlier video, I discussed how AB testing shapes the meritocracy and competitive culture at Facebook. We found thatthe white background caused a decrease in click-through rate and conversion rate:It made users feel like they were in a traditional e-commerce experience, rather than browsing for deals.


**Key Points:**

- I recordedStatsig’s first public demoover three years ago.

- Measuring our failure

- Understanding our failure

- The difference a white background can make

- The counterfactual of no A/B testing

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, inan earlier video, I discussed how AB testing shapes the meritocracy and competitive culture at Facebook.

### 119. Why Kayak lets you pick your plane

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kayak-aircraft-filter-feature


**Summary:**  
And neither were the passengers of Alaska Airlines flight 1282, whose emergency exit door fell out in January, forcing the pilot of the Boeing 737 Max to conduct an emergency landing. Example: Steve Hafner, the CEO of Kayak, goes on to say, “While the overall fraction of users filtering the 737 remains small, usage increased following the Alaska Airlines incident in January(15x compared to month prior from a low baseline), and it has since decreased until this past week (to 10x compared to Dec 2023).”
## What Kayak did right
This is a great example of companies reacting to user sentiment. Steve Hafner, the CEO of Kayak, goes on to say, “While the overall fraction of users filtering the 737 remains small, usage increased following the Alaska Airlines incident in January(15x compared to month prior from a low baseline), and it has since decreased until this past week (to 10x compared to Dec 2023).”

### 120. What is A/B testing and why is it important?

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-is-a-b-testing-and-why-is-it-important


**Summary:**  
Underlying AB testing is the concept of “randomized controlled trials (RCTs).” It is the gold standard in finding causality. Example: Let’s use one quick example, which also illustrates what “random assignment” is and its importance. ## Understanding treatment effect with an example
Suppose I claim that I have a magic pill that costs $100 and can increase the height of high school students by 1 inch over a year.


**Key Points:**

- With randomized assignments, the difference between the treatment group and the control group iscaused by the treatment.

- Test group:1000 students who voluntarily took the pill a year ago. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 62 inches this year.

- Control group:1000 students from the same schools with the same age. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 61 inches this year.

- Claim:We shipped a feature and metrics increased 10%

- Reality:The metrics will increase 10% without the feature, such as shipping a Black Friday banner before Black Friday.

- Claim:We shipped a feature, and users who use the feature saw 10% increase in their metrics

- Reality:The users who self-select into using the feature would see a 10% increase without the feature, such as giving a button to power users(ref: why most aha moments are wrong?)

- Humans are bad at attributions and are subject to lots of biases

### 122. Technical insights to a scalable experimentation system

**Date:** 2024-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/technical-insights-to-a-scalable-experimentation-system


**Summary:**  
(2022)highlighted, establishing trust in experimental results is challenging. Example: For example, a differential baseline between groups prior to a treatment is not statistically biased, but it is undesirable for making business decisions and usually requires resetting the test. In such cases, the cost of maintaining more experiments increases super-linearly, while the benefits increase sub-linearly.


**Key Points:**

- Historical Relevance:Experiments serve both decision-making and learning purposes, requiring a comprehensive understanding of both current and past experiments.

- Managerial incentives often encourage detrimental behaviors, such as p-hacking.

- Experiments may result in technical debt by leaving configurations within the codebase.

- The marginal return of experiments increases linearly or sub-linearly with scale, as less effort is available to turn information into impact.

- The marginal cost of experiments increases super-linearly with scale due to information and managerial overhead.

- Default-on experiments on all new features.

- Define metrics once, use everywhere.

- Reliable, traceable, and transparent data.

### 125. Why the uplift in A/B tests often differs from real-world results

**Date:** 2024-08-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-the-uplift-in-a-b-tests-often-differs-from-real-world


**Summary:**  
This disconnect can be puzzling and disappointing, especially when decisions and expectations are built around these tests. Example: A common example I’ve encountered with clients involves tests that yield inconclusive (non-significant) results. While reducing the significance level can decrease the number of false positives, it would also require longer test durations, which may not always be feasible.


**Key Points:**

- Human bias in analysis and interpretation

- False positives

- Sequential testing and overstated effect sizes

- Novelty effect and user behavior

- External validity and real-world factors

- Limited exposure in testing

- Strategies for mitigating discrepancies

### 127. How to pick metrics that make or break your experiments (including do&#39;s and don&#39;ts)

**Date:** 2024-08-14T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Elizabeth George  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-metrics-that-make-or-break-your-experiments


**Summary:**  
In fact, the wrong metrics can not only mislead your results but can also derail your entire strategy.


**Key Points:**

- Have a razor-sharp focus on one primary behavioral metric and a clearly aligned business metric.

- Anticipate and measure the negative consequences of your changes—because they’re inevitable.

- Use secondary metrics to fill in the gaps in your understanding. Without them, you’re operating in the dark.

- Ensure your experiment has enough power to provide conclusive, reliable results. Anything less is a waste of time.

- Stick with the same business metric for every experiment. If it doesn’t align with your specific goals, it’s irrelevant.

- Overcomplicate your analysis with a laundry list of metrics. Clarity and focus are your allies; distraction is your enemy.

- Over-interpret secondary data. If it’s not part of your primary hypothesis, it’s noise—don’t let it lead you astray.

- Your experiments are only as good as the metrics you choose.

### 128. How to plan test duration when using CUPED

**Date:** 2024-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-plan-test-duration-cuped


**Summary:**  
You understand that failing to plan the test duration can lead to underpowered tests and inflated false positive rates due to peeking. Example: Example:
In reality, we don't know the true values of the variables, so we must estimate them. Recently, you've been introduced toCUPED, an advanced statistical method that reduces KPI variance, resulting in more sensitive tests (lower MDE) or shorter test durations (lower sample size).


**Key Points:**

- Calculate the Non-CUPED Sample Size: Use the regular t-test sample size formula.

- Adjust Sample Size: Reduce the calculated sample size by the factor of \(\rho^2\).

- Suppose the non-CUPED sample size is 1000.

- Historical sampled data shows an estimated Pearson correlation of 0.9 between \(X\) and \(Y\).

- Calculate the variance reduction factor: \(0.9^2 = 0.81\).

- Adjust the sample size: \(1000 \times (1 - 0.81) = 190\).

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-i-saved-my-experiment-from-outliers


**Summary:**  
This is why health checks are acriticalpart of an experimentation platform—the more you’re proactively alerted about potential issues, the less likely you are to make a bad ship decision—and worse (in this case), have a bad learning experience.


**Key Points:**

- Change/Add winsorization to manage the influence of these outlier users, or add metric caps to a reasonable number like 5 signup clicks/day

- Use an explore query or qualifying event filter to eliminate these two users from the analysis

- Use an event-user metric instead

- Use Statsig’s recently releasedBot Detection

### 136. Controlling your type I errors: Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg

**Date:** 2024-07-31T10:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/controlling-type-i-errors-bonferroni-benjamini-hochberg


**Summary:**  
TheBenjamini-Hochberg Procedureis now available on Statsig as a way to reduce your false positives. Example: - FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons
FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons
- FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it
FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it
For each metric evaluation of one variant vs the control, we have:
In any online experiment, we’re likely to have more than just 1 metric and one variant in a given experiment, for example:
We generally recommend the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure as a less severe measure than the Bonferroni Correction, but which still protects you from some amount Type I errors.


**Key Points:**

- (Type I Error) I’m making unnecessary changes that don’t actually improve our product.

- (Type II Error) I missed an opportunity to make our product better because I didn’t detect a difference in my experiment.

- FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons

- FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it

### 137. Hypothesis Testing explained in 4 parts

**Date:** 2024-07-22T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-explained


**Summary:**  
As data scientists, Hypothesis Testing is expected to be well understood, but often not in reality. It is mainly because our textbooks blend two schools of thought – p-value and significance testing vs. Example: For example, some questions are not obvious unless you have thought through them before:
- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis? Third, to illustrate the two concepts concisely, let’s run a visualization by just changing the sample size from 30 to 100 and see how power increases from 86.3% to almost 100%.


**Key Points:**

- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis?

- Can we accept the null hypothesis? Why?

- How does MDE change with alpha holding beta constant?

- Why do we use standard error in Hypothesis Testing but not the standard deviation?

- Why can’t we be specific about the alternative hypothesis so we can properly model it?

- Why is the fundamental tradeoff of the Hypothesis Testing about mistake vs. discovery, not about alpha vs. beta?

- We emphasize a clear distinction between the standard deviation and the standard error, and why the latter is used in Hypothesis Testing

- We explain fully when can you “accept” a hypothesis, when shall you say “failing to reject” instead of “accept”, and why

### 139. Top 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them

**Date:** 2024-07-18T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/top-8-common-experimentation-mistakes-how-to-fix


**Summary:**  
I recently down with Allon Korem, CEO ofBell Statistics, and Tyler VanHaren, Software Engineer at Statsig, to discuss some of the most frequent mistakes companies can make in A/B testing and experimentation! I've summarized the discussion and outlined the 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them. By addressing these common testing mistakes, companies can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of their A/B tests.


**Key Points:**

- Data integrity:Ensure that your allocation point is consistent and verify your distributions using chi-squared tests to detect sample ratio mismatches.

- Skepticism and Vigilance:Regularly check data integrity over different segments and time periods to identify inconsistencies early.

- Proper Metrics:Collaborate with data science teams to ensure metrics are correctly defined and measured, focusing on meaningful business-driven KPIs.

- Statistical Methods:Use t-tests for means and z-tests for proportions in most cases. Ensure your statistical tests are relevant to your hypotheses.

- Peeking:Use sequential testing approaches to manage peeking. Tools like Statsig provide inflated confidence intervals for early data to mitigate premature conclusions.

- Underpowered Tests:Plan tests meticulously using power analysis calculators to ensure you have sufficient data to detect the expected changes.

- Handling Outliers:Use Windsorization to cap extreme values rather than removing outliers entirely, maintaining the integrity of your data.

- Cultural Challenges:Foster a culture that encourages upfront hypothesis formulation and continuous learning from experimentation.

### 140. Introducing Differential Impact Detection 

**Date:** 2024-07-17T09:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/differential-impact-detection


**Summary:**  
Statsig can now automatically surface heterogenous treatment effects across your user properties. In experimentation “one size fits all” is not always true. Example: For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users. For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users.


**Key Points:**

- Investigate the top sub-populations across each user property that you specify as a “Segment of Interest”

- For each primary metric in the experiment, determine if any sub-population has a different response to treatment

- Automatically surface a visualization of metrics sliced by user segments where one or more sub-population behaves significantly differently from the rest of the population

- Apply Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparison (check implementation details at the end)

- Concise Summarization of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Using Total Variation Regularized Regression

- Online Controlled Experiments: Introduction, Pitfalls, and Scaling(see pitfall 6: failing to look at segments)

- What are Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and why do we care?

**Author:** Mike London   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/identifying-experimenting-power-users-statsig


**Summary:**  
For most companies, power users are the driving force behind the success of many digital products, wielding significant influence and engagement compared to the average user. They are not only highly active and skilled with the features of a product, but they also often serve as brand ambassadors, providing valuable feedback and promoting the product within their networks. Example: - For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months. - For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months.


**Key Points:**

- For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months. The data helps you determine the power users. Quantitative.

- For example,at Statsig we have a customer advisory board and are in constant communication with customers via interviews and Slack channels. Qualitative.

### 142. How to Ingest Data Into Statsig

**Date:** 2024-07-16T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Logan Bates  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-ingest-data-into-statsig


**Summary:**  
During my endeavors as a data engineer, I’d spend hours helping teams translate data models and building data pipelines between software tools so they could effectively communicate. The frustration of getting the data into tools often spoiled the intended initial experience and added complexities to a production implementation. Event filters can be utilized to reduce downstream event volume to Statsig, so only your relevant metrics are analyzed.


**Key Points:**

- Access to your data source (e.g., data warehouse, 3rd party data tool/CDP, or application code).

- Necessary permissions to read from and write to your data source. (if applicable)

- Familiarity with SQL (if you're using a data warehouse)

- Use thelogEventmethod in various languages to quickly populate Statsig with data for experimentation and analysis

- Log additional metrics alongside 3rd party or internal logging systems to enhance measurement capabilities

- Use in situations where the SDKs are not supported or preferred

- Can be used to support custom metric ingestion workflows

- Quickly populate Statsig with metric data and analyze with themetrics explorer

### 143. Product experimentation best practices

**Date:** 2024-07-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-experimentation-best-practices


**Summary:**  
A good design document eliminates much of the ambiguity and uncertainty often encountered in the analysis and decision-making stages. Example: For example:
- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
### Power analysis, allocation, and duration
Allocation
This is the percentage of the user base that will be eligible for this experiment. These often include:
- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Se


**Key Points:**

- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)

- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)

- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric

- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs

- Running concurrent, mutually exclusive experiments requires allocating a fraction of the user base to each experiment.  On Statsig this is handled withLayers.

- A smaller allocation may be preferable for high-risk experiments, especially when the overall user base is large enough.

- For guardrail metrics: The MDE should be the largest regression size you’re willing to miss and ship unknowingly.

### 145. An overview of making early decisions on experiments 

**Date:** 2024-07-05T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Mike London   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/making-early-decisions-on-experiments


**Summary:**  
Online experimentation is becoming more commonplace across all types of businesses today. #### Rewards:
- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.


**Key Points:**

- Noisy data:Early data can be noisy and may not represent the true effect of the experiment, leading to incorrect conclusions (higher likelihood of false positives/false negatives).

- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.

- Resource allocation:Identifying a strong positive or negative trend can help decide whether to continue investing resources in the experiment.

- Select a population: Choose the appropriate population for your experiment. This could be based on a past experiment, a qualifying event, or the entire user base.

- Choose metrics: Input the metrics you plan to use as your evaluation criteria. You can add multiple metrics to analyze sensitivity in your target population.

- Run the power analysis: Provide the above inputs to the tool. Statsig will simulate an experiment, calculating population sizes and variance based on historical behavior.

- Review the readout: Examine the week-by-week simulation results. This will show estimates of the number of users eligible for the experiment each day, derived from historical data.

- It can shrink confidence intervals and p-values, which means that statistically significant results can be achieved with a smaller sample size.

### 146. Understanding significance levels: A key to accurate data analysis

**Date:** 2024-07-03  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-significance-levels-a-key-to-accurate-data-analysis


**Summary:**  
In this post, we provide an introduction to significance levels, what they are, and why they are important for data analysis. Example: For example, let's say you're comparing two versions of a feature using an A/B test. A lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) reduces the risk offalse positivesbut increases the risk of false negatives.


**Key Points:**

- P-values don't measure the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false.

- A statistically significant result doesn't necessarily imply practical significance or importance.

- The significance level (α) is not the probability of making a Type I error (false positive).

- In fields like medicine or aviation, where false positives can have severe consequences, a lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) may be more appropriate.

- For exploratory studies or when false negatives are more problematic, a higher significance level (e.g., 0.10) might be justified.

- P-values don't provide information about themagnitude or practical importanceof an effect.

- Focusing exclusively on p-values can lead to thefile drawer problem, where non-significant results are less likely to be published, creating a biased literature.

- P-values are influenced by sample size; large samples can yield statistically significant results for small, practically unimportant effects.

### 150. Statsig&#39;s Autotune adds contextual bandits for personalization

**Date:** 2024-06-26T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-autotune-contextual-bandits-personalization


**Summary:**  
These contextual bandits are a lightweight form of reinforcement learning that gives teams an easy way to personalize user experiences. Example: For example, a contextual bandit is a great choice to personalize if a user should see “Sports”, “Science”, or “Celebrities” as their top video unit; but it won’t be a good fit for determining which video (with new candidates every day, and with potentially tens of thousands of options) to show them. Running a few tests with Autotune AI can quickly give signal on how much there is to gain from personalizing product surfaces - potentially justifying investing in a dedicated team
## Start measuring your personalization
Hundreds of customers already use Statsig to measure improvements to theirpersonalization program.


**Key Points:**

- Don’t yet have the bandwidth to solve these problems, but want a placeholder for personalization as their teams get more mission-critical parts of their product built

- We’re excited to announce that Statsig’s multi-armed bandit platform (Autotune)now includes contextual bandits.

- When to use contextual bandits

### 151. Warehouse Native Year in Review

**Date:** 2024-06-25T12:15-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/warehouse-native-year-in-review


**Summary:**  
Since then, Warehouse Native has grown into a core product for us; we treat it with the same priority as Statsig Cloud, and have developed the two products to share core infrastructure, methodology, and design philosophies. Example: - More tools in the warehouse; for example, we have a beta version ofMetrics Explorerfor warehouse native customers and are excited to continue developing this - sharing a metric definition language between quick metric explorations and advanced statistical calculations helps bridge the gap between exploratory work and rigorous measurement. One of the competitive advantages we think Statsig has is “clock speed” - we just build faster than other teams building the same thing.


**Key Points:**

- Willingness - and internal/external alignment - to ship things that were functional-but-ugly

- Letting the development team play to their strengths

- Treating early customers like team members

- An Engineering “Code Machine” - someone who could crank out quality code twice as fast as other engineers

- A PM “Tech Lead” - someone who leads efforts across the company

- A DS “Product Hybrid” - someone who bridges product and engineering to solve complex business problems

- A year ago, Statsig announced Warehouse Native, bringing our experimentation platform into customers’ Data Warehouses.

- Why warehouse native?

### 161. How to debug your experiments and feature rollouts

**Date:** 2024-05-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-debug-your-experiments-and-feature-rollouts


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a product manager, or a software engineer, you know that even the most meticulously planned test rollout can encounter unexpected hiccups. Example: Statsig also allows you to override specific users, for example, if you wanted to test your feature with employees first in production. Statsig also offersstratified sampling; When experimenting on a user base where a tail-end of power users drive a large portion of an overall metric value, stratified sampling meaningfully reduces false positive rates and makes your results more consistent and trustworthy.


**Key Points:**

- Inadequate sampling: A sample that's too small or not representative of an evenly weighted distribution can lead to inconclusive or misleading results.

- Lack of confidence in metrics: Without trustworthy success metrics, it's harder to determine how to make a decision.

- User exposure issues: If users aren't exposed to the experiment as intended, your data won't reflect their true behavior.

- Biased experiments: Running multiple experiments that affect the same variables can contaminate your results.

- Technical errors: Bugs in the code can introduce unexpected variables that impact the experiment's outcome.

- Success criteria: Before launching an experiment, it's crucial to define how you’re measuring success. Make these metrics readily available for analysis.

- Running experiments mutually exclusively: To prevent experiments from influencing each other, consider using feature flagging frameworks.

- When it comes to digital experimentation and feature rollouts, the devil is often in the details.

### 164. How to track your features&#39; retention

**Date:** 2024-05-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-track-your-features-retention


**Summary:**  
The most common use of retention metrics that you’re familiar with, when A and B are the same action over different time periods T0 and T1, is just a special case of this more generalized definition. Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage. For example, day-of-week seasonality can be aggregated away by setting T0 and T1 to be 7 days in duration and measuring retention on a weekly cadence.


**Key Points:**

- Choosing appropriate A, B, T0, and T1

- The specificity vs sample size trade-off (choosing A)

- When repeated feature usage is more/less meaningful (choosing B)

- Evaluating useful time ranges (choosing T0, T1, and how many retention data points to generate)

- Using Metrics Explorer on Statsig to track feature retention

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage.

### 186. The role of confidence levels in statistical analysis

**Date:** 2024-04-04T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/confidence-levels-in-statistical-analysis


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a business analyst, or just someone interested in understanding the nuances of statistical inference, grasping the concept of confidence levels is crucial. Example: For example, a 95% confidence level suggests that if we were to conduct the same study 100 times, we would expect the true parameter to fall within our calculated confidence interval in 95 out of those 100 times.


**Key Points:**

- The sample statistic (e.g., the sample mean)

- The standard error of the statistic

- The desired confidence level

- CI:This stands for "Confidence Interval." It represents the range within which we expect the population mean to lie, given our sample mean and level of confidence.

- Sample Mean: This is the average value of your sample data. It is denoted by the symbol `x̄` (x-bar).

- ±:This symbol indicates that the confidence interval has two bounds: an upper bound and a lower bound.

- What is a confidence level?

- Get more confidence!

### 193. Novelty effects: Everything you need to know

**Date:** 2024-03-20T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/novelty-effects


**Summary:**  
Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness. Example: For example, feature level funnel, and feature level retention, can tell us whether users finished using the feature as we intended and whether they come back to the feature. Imagine this – the restaurant you pass by every day had a 100% improvement on their menu, their chef and their services.


**Key Points:**

- Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness.

- Not all products have novelty effects. They exist mostly in high-frequency products.

- Ignoring the temporary nature of novelty effects may lead to incorrect product decisions, and worse, bad culture.

- The most effective way to find novelty effects and control them is to examinethe time series of treatment effects.

- The root cause solution is to use a set of metrics that correctly represent user intents.

- When understood and used correctly, novelty effects can help you.

- Novelty effects are part of the treatment effects, so there is no statistical method to detect them generically

- Novelty effects are dangerous and will spread if you don’t combat them

**Summary:**  
Now, imagine discovering six months later that it actually reduced long-term retention. Example: Let's get practical with an example from Statsig.


**Key Points:**

- User behavior is unpredictable: Users might initially react positively to a new feature but lose interest over time.

- External factors: Events outside your control, such as a global pandemic, can drastically alter user engagement and skew your experiment results.

- You then model these early signals against historical data of known long-term outcomes. This helps predict the eventual impact on retention.

- It's important to choose surrogate indexes wisely. They must have a proven correlation with the long-term outcome you care about.

- Engaged user biasmeans you're mostly hearing from your power users. They're not your average customer, so their feedback might lead you down a narrow path.

- Selective sampling issuesoccur when you only look at a subset of users. This might make you miss out on broader trends.

- Diversify your data sources: Don't rely solely on one type of user feedback. Look at a mix of both highly engaged users and those less active.

- Use stratified sampling: This means you'll divide your user base into smaller groups or strata based on characteristics like usage frequency. Then, sample evenly from these groups.

### 195. Demystifying identity resolution

**Date:** 2024-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/demystifying-identity-resolution


**Summary:**  
The notion of “identity resolution” in the SaaS world continues to be an elusive gold standard that businesses want to solve in order to understand the full scope of customer behaviors across all touch-points. Example: ## Example ID resolution scenarios
Scenario 1:An unknown user visits the website and gets assigned to the “Test” group fornav_v2experiment using via a deviceID.


**Key Points:**

- No technology providers will solve every use-case and scenario perfectly, though many will make bold claims. There is a ton of nuance here and no one-size-fits-all solution.

- It is strictly impossible to reliably identify a single human interacting anonymously on two different devices that never identify themselves.

- Unknown user identity becomes the crux of the challenge. When switching devices, browsers, environments (server vs. client), or clearing device storage, this ID will not persist.

- The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds.

- A few disclaimers, debunkings, and considerations as we dive in:

- Identity boundary basics

- What does this have to do with experimentation?

**Author:** Sid Kumar and Skye Scofield   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/evaluate-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
Vitamin products make you better over time, but they don’t solve an acute problem right away.For many companies, experimentation platforms can feel like a vitamin product. Example: For example, if you're migrating from LaunchDarkly, you can take advantage of Statsig'smigration toolthat lets you port your feature flags in under 5 minutes! Experimentation platforms also fix other acute pain points, including:
- Giving teams a single source of truth for key product & growth metrics

**Date:** 2023-11-16T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ad-blockers-feature-management-testing-tools


**Summary:**  
There are many browser extensions out there today available to web users that help them block pesky ads around the web.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig’s presence on the block lists is less than other providers at the time of writing this, likely due to the fact that we were founded more recently—but this could change!

### 205. Onboarding for growth with A/B tests

**Date:** 2023-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/onboarding-for-growth-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
For B2B SaaS applications, a user’s very first login or download experience has a significant influence on their engagement metrics. Example: Example experiment hypothesis: Tooltip pop-ups at every screen might empower users to progress through the onboarding workflow, thereby increasing the percentage of onboarding completions and subsequently active usage. The quicker you guide them to this revelation (decrease time-to-value), the more likely they are to become sticky, which significantly impacts core metrics such as daily active users (DAU) and ultimately retention and net recurring revenue (NRR).


**Key Points:**

- Incorporating contextual tooltips or pop-ups that empower users to navigate through the workflow (sometimes even including a brief autoplay tutorial)

- Highlighting specific high-value feature(s) that give early wins for users

- Featuring a “one-click quick start” or similar capability that automatically configures basic parameters for immediate use of features

- Offering different plans such as a free trial with limited features vs a premium trial with full access

- Personalizing messaging based on the user's persona such as their industry or role

- Offering discounts in the eleventh hour is not the growth strategy of champions.

- Successful onboarding-for-growth implementations

- Testing and identifying winning features

### 208. Online experimentation: The new paradigm for building AI applications

**Date:** 2023-04-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Palak Goel and Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-products-require-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:
First, product managers would come up with a new idea for a product and lay out a release timeline. Example: But the risks are palpable—for every AI success story, there’s an example of a biased model sharing misinformation, or a feature being pulled due to safety concerns. #### In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today.


**Key Points:**

- How can you launch and iterate on features quickly without compromising your existing user experience?

- How can you move fast while ensuring your apps are safe and reliable?

- How can you ensure that the features you launch lead to substantive, differentiated improvements in user outcomes?

- How can you identify the optimal prompts and models for your specific use case?

- Build compelling AI features that engage users

- Flight dozens of models, prompts and parameters in the ‘back end’ of these features

- Collect data on all inputs and outputs

- Use this data to select the best-performing variant and fine-tune new models

**Author:** Geunbae &#34;GB&#34; Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-importance-of-design-in-b2b-saas


**Summary:**  
The expectations of a delightful user experience—previously reserved for the realm of B2C products—have bled into B2B space as well, with enterprise customers expecting to be delighted by the look and feel of the products that they’re using. Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.


**Key Points:**

- A well-designed product is a strong foundation

- A well-designed product is your value prop, an edge vs. competitors

- A well-designed product helps your team to move faster

- A well-designed product is key in establishing your brand

- Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.

### 215. Understanding the role of the 95% confidence interval

**Date:** 2022-08-04T16:31:57.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/95-percent-confidence-interval


**Summary:**  
Yet its validity and usefulness is often questioned. Example: For example, startup companies that have a high risk tolerance will want to minimize false negatives by selecting lower confidence intervals (e.g., 80% or 90%). I’m a proponent of 95%confidence intervalsand recommend them as a solid default.


**Key Points:**

- A range of plausible values

- An indicator of how repeatable/stable our experimental method is

- It’s a reasonable low bar.In practice, it’s an achievable benchmark for most fields of research to remain productive.

- It’s ubiquitous.It ensures we’re all speaking the same language. What one team within your company considers significant is the same as another team.

- Set your confidence threshold BEFORE any data is collected. Cheaters change the confidence interval after there’s an opportunity to peek.

- Gelman, Andrew (Nov. 5, 2016).“Why I prefer 50% rather than 95% intervals”.

- Gelman, Andrew (Dec 28, 2017).“Stupid-ass statisticians don’t know what a goddam confidence interval is”.

### 217. CUPED on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-07-07T21:55:42.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics. Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).


**Key Points:**

- The more stable a metric tends to be for the same user over time, the more CUPED can reduce variance and pre-experiment bias

- CUPED utilizespre-exposuredata for users, so experiments on new users or newly logged metrics won’t be able to leverage this technique

- Getting in the habit of setting up key metrics and starting to track metrics before an experiment starts will help you to get the most out of CUPED on Statsig

- Run experiments with more speed and accuracy

- How this will help you

- Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).

- Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics.

**Summary:**  
Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear.”

- Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
- Make it trivial to test a change with a small section of users, and progressively expand the blast radius; for example, start by dog-fooding features with internal employees, then open up to a small group customers, say, who asked for the feature, then expand more broadly

### 219. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Example: For example, if you typed “#m lgtm” the bot would respond with the macro lgtm, an image of a doge saying looks good to me. A few main reasons:
- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.


**Key Points:**

- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Within the Admin Panel -> Select Integrations -> Click Create custom integration

- Within Permissions, check “Group chat bot”, “Message any member”, and “Read all messages”

- You should get back a url that looks like this:http://71c8-216-207-142-218.ngrok.io. Input that as the callback url in the page webhook.

- Open uphttp://localhost:4040/in your browser. Here is where you can see requests sent and received by your webhook.

**Date:** 2022-05-19T15:17:22.000Z  
**Author:** Geunbae &#34;GB&#34; Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/early-startup-journey-my-first-year-at-statsig


**Summary:**  
A year ago on May 19th, 2021, I took a big leap of faith and departed my satisfying job at Facebook to join an early stage startup calledStatsig. To me, awell-defined design system is an essential building block(foundation)that will help us move and innovate faster.Without the Design System in place, it is difficult to maintain consistency while building quickly.


**Key Points:**

- Designing ourStatsig company websiteand visual assets

- Contributing to theStatsig documentations page

- Making various marketing assets (blog/video banner image, voice of customer series, press release assets etc)

- Managing our social media channel (primarily LinkedIn)

- Branding (swags, business cards, conference pamphlets, posters etc)

- Celebrating my first Statsig-versary with a blog post full of memories.

- The full journey

- Why I decided to join

### 221. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
They’re trying several ideas at any given time. If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.


**Key Points:**

- Have a clear set of questions the holdout is designed to answer. This will guide your design, holdout duration, value you get and will dictate what costs make sense to incur.

- Understand the costs associated with holdouts. Make sure teams that will pay those costs understand holdout goals and buy in.

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Feature Level Holdouts

- Measuring Cumulative Impact

- If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.

### 222. There’s More To Learn From Tests

**Date:** 2022-04-20T18:45:44.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts!) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way. Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.


**Key Points:**

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

- The target population is split randomly for a test, where some get the solution (Test) and some don’t (Control)

- Unrealized Value: Testing to Understand

- Don’t Waste Your Tests: Take Time to Think About The Results

- Parting Thoughts

- Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/launching-be-significant


**Summary:**  
If you’re with a startup that was founded less than two years ago, has raised less than $20 million, and employs less than 20 people, you canapply nowtoday. Butwhy haven’t startups gotten better at validating PMF faster?One reason is the lack of data and absence of tools to mine the insights from this data.


**Key Points:**

- Welcome to Statsig’s Startup Accelerator Program

- What hasn’t changed

- What has changed

- Reducing the Cost of Experimentation

### 224. Modernizing the Customer Data Stack

**Date:** 2022-04-18T21:30:15.000Z  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/modernizing-the-customer-data-stack


**Summary:**  
There are two key factors influencing this rapid modernization:
- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.


**Key Points:**

- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.

- Businesses want to leverage rapidly evolving and automated data intelligence inside their customer-facing applications.

- Websites, mobile applications and server side applications.

- If a business is generating calculated metrics, model outputs or cohorts in a warehouse, that ultimately becomes a data producer as well.

- Help desks, payment systems, marketing tools, A/B testing tools, ad platforms, CRMs, etc.

- Too many custom pipelines, SDKs and transformations decrease the fidelity and manageability of data over time.

- It’s impossible to enforce schema standardization across channels without introducing latency (Everyone loves a bolt onMDM… right?).

- It’s impossible to resolve user identities across channels without complex user identity services, which introduce latency.

**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/we-fooled-ourselves-first


**Summary:**  
While the sales team wrangled everyone around a Magic 8 Ball, Vijaye Raji (Founder & CEO) had his own April 1st surprise gated on the company’s website and he used Statsig’s own Feature Gates to test it out. Example: A common example (that Statsig’s website uses as well) isGDPRcookie consent for countries in the EU.


**Key Points:**

### 227. Democratizing Experimentation

**Date:** 2022-03-21T05:41:41.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/democratizing-experimentation


**Summary:**  
When building out instant games on Facebook a few years back, a new developer switched to use a newer version of an internal SDK. Example: (once measures turn into goals, it’s possible to incent behavior that’s undesirable unless we’re prudent; see theHanoi Rat Problemfor an interesting example)
Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want? A more experienced teammate noticed the change reduced time spent in the game.


**Key Points:**

- Is the metric movement explainable?

- Are all significant movements being reported, not just the positive ones?

- Are guardrail metrics being violated?

- Is there a quota we’re drawing from?

- Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want?

- Guarding againstp-hacking (or selective reporting)(often by establishing guidelines like using ~14 day windows to report results over;see more about reading results safely here.)

- Amazon famously reduced distractions during checkout flows to improve conversion. This is a pattern that most ecommerce sites now optimize for.

- Experiment Review Best Practices

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/failing-fast-kiss-a-lot-of-frogs


**Summary:**  
In a startup, everybody builds stuff (code, websites, sales lists, etc) — and part of the building process is accepting that not everything you make is good.


**Key Points:**

- Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast.

### 231. Introducing Autotune: Statsig’s Multiarmed Bandit

**Date:** 2022-02-03T20:33:11.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-autotune


**Summary:**  
MAB is a well-known probability problem that involves balancing exploration vs exploitation (Ref. Example: ### Case Study: A Real Autotune Test on statsig.com
Statsig’s website (www.statsig.com) showcases Statsig’s products and offerings. We provide a few parameters to play with, but for most use-cases you can use the defaults like we did:
- exploration window (default = 24 hrs) — The initial time that Autotune will evenly split traffic.


**Key Points:**

- Determining which product(s) to feature on a one-day Black Friday sale (resource = time, payout = revenue).

- Showing the best performing ad given a limited budget (resource = budget, payout = clicks/visits).

- Selecting the best signup flow given a finite amount of new users (resource = new users, payout = signups).

- Maximizing Gain:When resources are scarce and maximizing payoff is critical.

- Multiple Variations:Bandits are good at focusing traffic on the most promising variations. Bandits can be quite useful vs traditional A/B testing when there are >4 variations.

- winner threshold (default = 95%) — The confidence level Autotune will use to declare a winner and begin diverting 100% of traffic towards.

- statsig.logEvent(‘click’):Logs a successful click. This combined with getConfig() allows Autotune to compute the click-thru rate.

- Under an A/B/C/D test, 75% of the traffic would have been diverted to inferior variations (vs 42% for Autotune).

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/definitive-guide-ecommerce-growth


**Summary:**  
I’ve done it thrice, first with Flipkart, then with a company that I founded myself, then at Amazon. Example: For example, anA/B testfor checkout on the Vancouver Olympic Store showed that a single page checkout performed 21.8% better than the multi-step checkout. Large improvements deeper in the funnel require a smaller sample size to test and make every upstream step more effective.


**Key Points:**

- E-commerce is hard.

- 1. Optimizing Conversion Rate

- Crushing the Gloom of Cart Abandonment

- Lighting-up Add-to-Cart Conversions

- 2. Growing Visitors

- Content is Central

- Double Down by Targeting

**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/environments-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments. Example: The solution for this is to create rules explicitly for the Dev and Staging environments (like in the global config example above). It optimizes for engineering efficiency : reducing errors and making troubleshooting faster.


**Key Points:**

- Two philosophies : Per Environment Config vs Global Config

- Wrinkles (and mitigation)

### 238. How Statsig Designs SDKs for Different Application Environments

**Date:** 2021-10-22T05:10:07.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in. Example: For example, our JavaScript client SDK is only12kb minified + Gzipped. #### At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

- 1. Serves a single user at a time

- 2. Not in a secure environment, i.e. assume everything is public

- 3. The device is not always connected to the Internet

- 4. Sensitive to binary size, data usage and latency

- 1. Serves many users from one machine

- 2. Each server runs for a long time

- Example: For example, our JavaScript client SDK is only12kb minified + Gzipped.

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. Example: Try plugging your pitch into this template:
“[company]helps customers[verb] [business outcome]by[tech capability].”

### 241. Embrace Overlapping A/B Tests and Avoid the Dangers of Isolating Experiments

**Date:** 2021-10-08T06:44:42.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/embracing-overlapping-a-b-tests-and-the-danger-of-isolating-experiments


**Summary:**  
How to handle simultaneous experiments frequently comes up. Example: For example, one cannot test new ranking algorithm A (vs control) and also new ranking algorithm B (vs control) in overlapping tests. This method maintains experimental power, but can reduce accuracy (as I’ll explain later, this is not a major drawback).


**Key Points:**

- Isolated tests— Users are split into segments, and each user is enrolled in only one experiment. Your experimental power is reduced, but accuracy of results are maintained.

- Microsoft’s Online Controlled Experiments At Scale

- How Google Conducts More experiments

- Can You Run Multiple AB Tests At The Same Time?

- Large Scale Experimentation at Spotify

- Running Multiple A/B Tests at The Same Time: Do’s and Dont’s

- AtStatsig, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting many experimentalists from different backgrounds and experiences.

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ab-testing-for-dummies


**Summary:**  
Since then, my level of understanding has graduated from preschool to elementary- nice! Example: Let me give you an example- for awhile, Facebook was testing out pimple popping videos to engage more folks on video. A/B testing means we can try out more features and quickly see which ones work.Instead of just holding onto one idea and running with it for 6 months, by progressively rolling out new ideas all the time, companies build better products faster.


**Key Points:**

- This is what I googled on my first day with Statsig.

- Example: Let me give you an example- for awhile, Facebook was testing out pimple popping videos to engage more folks on video.

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-conversion-in-e-commerce


**Summary:**  
Today, I want to share an inside look into experimentation at a popular financial services company that offers payment processing services and APIs for e-commerce applications¹. Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience. This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.


**Key Points:**

- How experimentation moves the numbers in a popular payment processing company

- Experimentation is core to product development

- Experimentation with a smaller user base

- Choosing the right metrics

- All in on Experimentation

- Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience.

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-auth0-nailed-demand-generation


**Summary:**  
Similarly, reducing friction during evaluation means that we enable these leads to get qualified as efficiently as possible. Example: Let’s use a case study to see how a well-oiled demand generation engine works. #### Automating Demand Generation in Three Steps
Product-led Growth (PLG) is magical because it does two things really well:
- It reduces the cost of acquiring leads
It reduces the cost of acquiring leads
- It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product
It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product
Reducing the cost of acquiring leads means that we make lead generation as automated and efficient as possible.


**Key Points:**

- It reduces the cost of acquiring leads

- It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product

- Automating Demand Generation in Three Steps

- How an enterprise company found Auth0

### 249. My Five Favorite Things About Swift

**Date:** 2021-05-11T07:20:26.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/my-five-favorite-things-about-swift


**Summary:**  
I started doing iOS development at Facebook, which only used Objective-C for its iOS apps. Example: For example, instead of concatenating strings like this:
NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;
NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;
NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];
we can now do this:
let firstMsg = “Concatenating strings in Swift “
let secondMsg = “is EAZY”
let fullMsg = firstMsg + secondMsg
### 2. #### Statsigstrives to empower all developers to ship features faster, so naturally one of the first milestones for us was to provide an SDK for iOS development.


**Key Points:**

- optional parameters and labels

- 1. Swift is much more readable

- 2. Swift supports modern language features

- 3. No more header files!

- 4. Some nice quirks that I didn’t know I wanted

- 5. Easy to port to Objective-C

- Example: For example, instead of concatenating strings like this:
NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;
NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;
NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];
we can now do this:
let firstMsg = “Concatenating strings in Swift “
let secondMsg = “is EAZY”
let fullMsg = firstMsg + secondMsg

**Key Points:**

- 41 bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- 14 bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- 9 bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

- Defining a millisecond maximum time travel thresholdMMTTT(sometimes shortened asM2T3).

- Comparing the current generation timestampCtwith the previous generation timestampPt. WhenCt < Ct + MMTTT < Pt, RUIDs are generated withPtas the timestamp.

- Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

- Should you use it?

### 1. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong: Navigating multiple comparison corrections in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparison-corrections-in-a-b


**Summary:**  
This occurs when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted simultaneously, whether it’s peeking at the data during the experiment, examining several key performance indicators (KPIs), or analyzing different segments of the population. Example: For example, with an alpha of 5% and 5 tests, you would reject the null hypothesis for p-values lower than 0.01, instead of 0.05. Additionally, strict corrections like Bonferroni significantly reduce statistical power.


**Key Points:**

- Rank all p-values in ascending order.

- For each p-value, calculate 𝑖 / 𝑚 * 𝛼, where i is the rank of the p-value (according to step 1) and m is the total number of tests.

- Find the largest rank (k) for which the p-value is smaller than the value calculated in step 2.

- Reject all hypotheses till rank k.

- 1 control group, drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 12.

- 7 treatment groups, sampled from the same distribution as the control (i.e., no true effect).

- 3 treatment groups, each with a true revenue uplift of 2.5% (mean = 102.5).

- The proportion of significant results among the three treatment groups with true effects.

### 3. Sink, swim, or scale: What startups teach us about launching AI

**Date:** 2025-08-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Alexey Komissarouk  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-startups-lessons-learned


**Summary:**  
About the guest author.Alexey Komissarouk is aGrowth Engineering Advisorwho teachesGrowth Engineering on Reforge. Previously, he was the Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Early users, however, complained they “still didn’t know what to do with this thing.”Notion pivotedfrom “AI writes for you” to “AI improves what you’ve already written,” redesigned starter prompts, and saw usage rise as the mental cost of exploration dropped.


**Key Points:**

- Pre‑negotiate burst capacity with vendors (spot GPUs, secondary clouds, reseller credits) so you scale up within minutes without surprise bills.

- Offer a “happy hour” off‑peak tier that absorbs hobby traffic without harming premium latency.

- Replace blank prompt boxes with role‑based starter chips and one‑click examples that autofill.

- Instrument “prompt redo” and “undo” events as frustration signals; run weekly funnel reviews on them.

- Offer an “explain my last prompt” toggle—turning trial‑and‑error into guided learning.

- When financially viable, start with a flat plan that eliminates mental transaction costs; layer in usage-based overages only once users reach actual ceilings.

- Expose “token burn so far” inside the interface, not tucked away in billing dashboards.

- Run price‑sensitivity experiments onengagedcohorts, not top‑of‑funnel sign‑ups; willingness to pay lags perceived mastery.

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. Example: Another great example is Notion AI, which writes and summarizes within your existing workspace. Keep response time below 200 ms and uptime above 99.9 %, and you’ve passed.


**Key Points:**

- Google's Geminioutperformed GPT-4 on 30 of 32 benchmarksand beat humans on language understanding tests. Once deployed, it suggestedadding glue to pizzato make cheese stick better.

- Perplexity faced lawsuitsforcreating fake news sectionsand falsely attributing content to real publications.

- Note: We recently launched our Evals product that solves this problem - clickhereto learn more

- Monitor success metrics.These metrics become your real quality benchmarks. The easiest way to do this is with product analytics.

- Watch user sessions.Record user interactions to understand the stories behind metrics - why users drop off, where confusion occurs, when they ignore AI suggestions.

- Ship big changes as A/B tests.Do 50/50 rollouts of what you think will be big wins to quantify the impact. This helps your team build intuition for what actually moves the needle.

- Expand.Ship features to larger and larger groups of users, monitoring success metrics and bad outcomes as you go.

### 6. The more the merrier? The problem of multiple comparisons in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-07-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results? Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

- How to deal with multiple comparisons

- Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.

### 7. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift.


**Key Points:**

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

- It is less susceptible to external shocks (holidays, marketing pulses).

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- Use proxies, not your KPIs

- Boost signal and reduce noise with thoughtful statistics

- Covariate adjustment (CUPED & CURE)


---


### 8. You can have it all: Parallel testing with A/B tests

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel. By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.


**Key Points:**

- Why test in parallel?

- What should you watch out for?

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel.

- By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.

**Author:** Israel Ben Baruch  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/move-forward-the-a-b-testing-mindset-guide


**Summary:**  
Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time. It sharpens your thinking and helps you act faster if your current test fails.


**Key Points:**

- Be obsessed.You check results more than you should. You run through your funnels again and again. Your head swarms with ideas. You’re not crazy, you’re exactly where you should be.

- Organizational culture.Your mindset needs an organization that supports it - one that encourages people to take risks, experiment, and always push forward.

- Professional expertise.CRO is a craft. Find the people, the content, and the companies to learn from. Apply. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. Most importantly: keep evolving.

- Great tools.Use high-quality, reliable measurement and testing platforms. They’re the foundation of effective testing. No compromises.

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

### 10. Experimentation and AI: 4 trends we’re seeing 

**Date:** 2025-06-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. Example: Example: It has become common for chat interface-based apps (like ChatGPT, Vercel V0, Lovable) to experiment with suggested prompts to help users quickly discover and realize value, which subsequently drives engagement and retention.


**Key Points:**

- Good logging on all the product metrics you care about

- The ability to link these metrics to everything you release

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

- Trend 2: More AI code drives the need for quantitative optimization

- Trend 3: Every engineer is a growth engineer

- Trend 4: Product value comes from your unique context

- Closing thoughts: AI is part of every product

### 11. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. Example: For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes.


**Key Points:**

- the number of units in the control group is relatively small, and

- the denominator is relatively noisy (but still statistically distinct from 0)

- \( Z_{\alpha/2} \) is the critical value associated with the desired confidence level

- \( \mathrm{var}(X_C) \) is the variance of the control group metric values

- \( n_C \) is the number of units in the control group

- \( \overline{X_C} \) is the mean of the control group metric values

### 12. Why data and intuition aren&#39;t enemies

**Date:** 2025-05-30T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Laurel Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-data-and-intuition-arent-enemies


**Summary:**  
I’ve always been excited by the power of data storytelling. Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example. Metrics are often consulted only when something breaks, not when there is an opportunity to improve.


**Key Points:**

- Great products come from intuition guided by data, not intuition versus data.

- The uphill battle for metrics adoption

- Reframing the relationship between data and intuition

- The adaptive nature of good metrics

- Moving forward with adaptive taste

- Finding a data-informed culture at Statsig

- Product manager playbook

- Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example.

### 13. Empowering your team is the future of product leadership

**Date:** 2025-05-28T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. Paradoxically,trying to control everything actually reduces your control over what matters most.


**Key Points:**

- Defining outcomes that matter rather than dictating every task

- Providing context about user needs and business priorities

- Creating frameworks that enable autonomous decision-making

- Trusting your engineers to determine the "how" once they understand the "why"

- The challenge of proving value

- The two paths for product leaders

- The brute force PM

- The force-multiplier leader


---


### 14. Chasing metrics, not tasks: Why outcome-obsessed PMs win

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. One of my focus areas was improving our customer acquisition funnel.


**Key Points:**

- Misaligned incentives:Measuring success by task completion rather than outcome impact reinforced a culture of checking boxes rather than driving real business results.

- Letting go of sunk costs:When the data shows an initiative isn’t working, cut it – no matter how much time you’ve invested.

- Zooming out regularly:That metric you’ve been optimizing might not be the one that matters most. Don’t miss the forest for the trees.

- My metrics-focused foundation

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- The roadmap is a false comfort

- The buy-in breakthrough

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 15. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- How do you interpret the outcome of a non-inferiority test?

- How do you properly integrate non-inferiority tests into your company's A/B testing process?

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

- Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine.

- In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.

### 16. Fail faster, learn faster: Why &#34;done&#34; beats &#34;perfect&#34; in modern product management

**Date:** 2025-05-20T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. Shipping thin slices lets you take more at-bats, improve your swing, and learn from each attempt.


**Key Points:**

- Create feedback loops to build learnings from users quickly

- Limit the potential downsides if a feature underperforms and course correct

- Build stakeholder confidence by showing visible progress

- Collect real-world feedback that no amount of planning can substitute for

- Build organizational muscle memory for rapid learning

- Create space for high-risk, high-reward ideas that might be killed in a "perfect first time" culture

- Free up resources to pursue more opportunities rather than polishing a single feature

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

### 17. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. Example: For example, let’s say you true north metric is the revenue generated in the next year. Over time, product changes can improve or degrade the quality of prediction that a particular surrogate model produces.


**Key Points:**

- Inputs should be independent of assignment. Assignment to any given experiment group should be random and not correlated to any input to the predictive model.

- Outputs should not exhibit heteroscedasticity. For each predicted value, the prediction and the expected magnitude of the error term should not be correlated.

- Best Practice for ML Engineering

**Date:** 2025-05-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.


**Key Points:**

- Control feature releases– Seamlessly roll out features to targeted groups for testing and iteration.

- Measure impact with experimentation– Understand exactly how changes affect user behavior and business outcomes.

- Unify product data– Gain a single source of truth across users, features, and application performance.

- Analyze insights in real-time– Explore trends, dig into metrics, and respond to user behavior instantly.

- Monitor and optimize application performance– Collect all your application metrics in one place, and link releases directly to changes in performance or outages

- Capture qualitative feedback– Understand the “why” behind the data with session replays

- Expanding our platform– More integrations, deeper analytics, and enhanced AI-driven insights.

- Growing our team– Bringing on top talent to support our customers and scale our impact.

### 19. Continuous promotion for infrastructure with Statsig and Pulumi

**Date:** 2025-04-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics.


**Key Points:**

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

- Deployments that must be paused for manual sign‑off orchange‑management windows

- Initialize the Statsig server SDK at the start of your deployment.

- Get deployment decision from feature flags or dynamic configs.

- Deploy the target resources.

- Approve:Manually green‑light the next phase once metrics look good.

- Pause:Hold the rollout at the current phase to gather more data or schedule windows.

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Example: Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:
Figure 3:A P95 performance graph comparing our legacy Node SDK (green) and Node Core SDK (blue) runtime for a gate check. With Rust's memory safety, performance, concurrency, and zero-cost abstractions, the improvements to actual evaluation time have been huge enough to outweigh the binding costs.


**Key Points:**

- pyo3 (Python):Getting started - PyO3 user guide

- napi-rs (Node):Getting started – NAPI-RS

- jni-rs (Java):GitHub - jni-rs/jni-rs: Rust bindings to the Java Native Interface

- ruslter (Elixir):GitHub - rusterlium/rustler: Safe Rust bridge for creating Erlang NIF functions

### 21. The rise of experimentation as the industry standard

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. Example: One notable example is the16-month TV advertising experimentAmazon ran in a few markets, which showed that TV ads delivered only a modest sales bump. In the new model we grow bylearning faster—hundreds of tiny, controlled bets that compound.


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- Experimenting with the length of forms to mitigate user dropoffs

- Using 20% of an email audience to suss out the best email subject line and sending it to the remaining 80%

- Testingvirtually anythingin a focus group

- Implementing customer surveys to gauge reactions to potential upcoming initiatives

- Jeff Bezos on the importance of experimentation

- A booming market for experimentation platforms like Statsig

- Examples of high-impact experiments

### 22. Digital marketing attribution models: A tech survey

**Date:** 2025-04-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. Example: Early versions were still rule-based (for example, splitting credit evenly or favoring the first and last touches). MMM emerged in the 1950s (though it rose to popularity in the 1980s) as a top-down approach that uses aggregate data and statistical regression to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel to sales [1].


**Key Points:**

- Shapley Value Attribution

- Algorithmic/Statistical Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ML)

- Incrementality Testing and Lift Models

- Causal Inference-Based Multi-Channel Attribution

- Customer Journey-based Deep Learning Models

- Captures sequential nature of journeys.

- Explains results via the “If we remove channel X, how many conversions are lost?” logic, which is intuitive.

- More nuanced than any single-position rule; channels that primarily appear in converting paths get more credit.

### 23. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Example: For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:
On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of. We also have tools likeCUPEDthat will control for values that we can see before the experiment, avoiding the worst of the bias and making your experiments run faster.


**Key Points:**

- You have to choose experiments that can be applied across pages, and that you'd expect to have a similar impact on each of the pages you'd apply it to.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

- Image optimizations,such as enabling lazy loading across all pages.

- Multimedia enhancements,like adding audio versions of blog posts to see if this boosts engagement or traffic.

- Challenges of SEO A/B testing

- Designing your experiment

- Sidecar no-code A/B testing

- The right tools for the job

### 24. How to accurately test statistical significance

**Date:** 2025-04-12T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/steps-to-accurately-test-statistical-significance


**Summary:**  
This is where the concept of statistical significance comes into play, helping you make confident choices based on solid data. Example: For example, when testing if a new feature increases user engagement, the null hypothesis would be that engagement remains unchanged. For example, when testing if a new feature increases user engagement, the null hypothesis would be that engagement remains unchanged.


**Key Points:**

- Avoid making decisions based on false positives or random noise

- Identify genuine patterns and relationships that can inform strategic choices

- Allocate resources and investments towards initiatives with proven impact

- Minimize the risk of costly mistakes or missed opportunities

- Clearly define your null and alternative hypotheses based on the question you're investigating

- Select an α that balances the risks ofType I and Type II errorsfor your specific context

- Ensure your sample size is adequate to detect meaningful differences at your chosen α

- A p-value does not indicate the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false. It only measures the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis were true.

### 25. Best practices for feature flags in serverless environments like AWS Lambda

**Date:** 2025-04-04T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flags-in-serverless


**Summary:**  
Feature flags empower developers to flexibly control serverless code without full redeployment, but they can also negatively impact cold starts and microservice dependencies. These can increase latency andnegatively impact user experiences.


**Key Points:**

### 26. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. Example: For example, a treatment’s impact on revenue might be most noticeable among high-spending players, where behavioral changes are more pronounced. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects.


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type II error (β):The probability of failing to detect a true improvement when one exists.

- Set the winsorization threshold (X%):In A/B testing, common choices are 1% or 0.1%, depending on the required adjustment and sample size.

- Replace extreme values:Values beyond these thresholds are capped at the corresponding percentile values.

- Why outliers can be harmful

- How to identify outliers

- What to do with outliers

- Time for winsorization!

### 27. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Example: For example, if you’re trying out a new shipping policy, you can apply it in one state while leaving a similar region as control. ### 3.Phased Rollouts
A phased rollout gradually increases the share of users or clusters that see a new feature (e.g., 1% to 10% to 50%), always using random assignment at each step.


**Key Points:**

- Ensure consistent assignment: If you want a single user to see the same variant as both a buyer and a seller, factor that into your randomization logic.

### 28. What no one tells you about feature flags and messy code

**Date:** 2025-03-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others. Example: Let's walk through an example. For example, if the flag is being used to slowly roll out a new checkout experience, and you're aiming for 100% rollout by the end of the month, create a “Removeff_new_checkout” ticket with a due date 30–45 days after full rollout.


**Key Points:**

- [ ] Remove all `if/else` conditions using `ff_new_checkout`

- [ ] Delete the flag from Statsig’s dashboard (mark as deprecated first)

- [ ] Remove related experiment code or tracking if applicable

- [ ] Update documentation or `FLAGS.md` if needed

- [ ] Confirmation that no users are on the legacy flow

- [ ] No recent rollbacks in the past 14 days

- When should this flag be removed?

- Who’s responsible for removing it?

### 29. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. - Tightening the Confidence (Credible) Interval:Alternatively, one can choose a narrower prior that reduces uncertainty in the posterior distribution.


**Key Points:**

- The choice of priors can strongly influence the resulting posterior estimates, requiring careful calibration to avoid unintentionally skewing the analysis.

- Neither type of informed Bayesian approach is “wrong” in principle, but the first introduces a greater risk of data manipulation, while the second can slow down decision-making.

- In many cases, the second approach is effectively equivalent to applying FDR-type frequentist adjustments and often yields the same outcomes, just framed in Bayesian terms.

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

### 31. Why buying an experimentation platform makes more sense than building one

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/buying-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
“Building your own experimentation platform made a lot of sense… five years ago,” says our customer Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager - Core ML at Whatnot, who previously worked on DoorDash’s in-house platform. Example: For example, over the past year we’ve shipped several advanced capabilities that you won’t find in a typical experimentation platform:
- Stats methodologies such as stratified sampling, differential impact detection, interaction detection, Benjamini Hochberg procedure etc. Over the past few years, several companies have moved away from in-house experimentation tooling and turned to Statsig to scale their experimentation cultures.Notionincreased their experimentation velocity by 30x within a year.Limewent from limited testing to experimenting on every change before rolling it out.


**Key Points:**

- Server & client-side SDKsfor seamless experimentation across all surfaces without impacting performance

- Data logging, ingestion and processing servicesand/or integration with your data warehouse

- Randomization functionsfor accurate user allocations in different scenarios

- Experiment result computationsincluding metric lifts, p-values, confidence intervals, and other statistical calculations

- Automated checks(like power analysis, balanced exposures) to ensure experiments are properly set up and issues are identified proactively

- Statistical correctionsto account for outliers, pre-experimental bias, and differential impact, etc. to provide trustworthy results

- Variance reduction(CUPED, winsorization)

- Experimentation techniqueslike sequential testing, switchback testing, geo-based tests etc.

### 33. KPI traps: How &#34;successful&#34; experiments can still be failures

**Date:** 2025-03-05T00:02-08:00  
**Author:** Lin Jia  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kpi-traps-successful-experiments-can-fail


**Summary:**  
You set up the experiment cautiously, collected data diligently, and celebrated when it achieved statistical significance for your KPI. Example: For example, a company notices that customer service calls are taking too long. When they run a two-week experiment to measure the impact, they find that DAU increases as more users return to the app.


**Key Points:**

- Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever.

- Success on paper, but failure in practice

- False positive risk

- False positive risk given the success rate, p-value threshold of 0.025 (successes only), and 80% power

- How to avoid KPI traps

- Align KPIs with business goals

- Use multiple metrics including high-level objective, user behaviors, and guardrails

- Monitor long-term effects for shipped experiments

### 37. Beyond prompts: A data-driven approach to LLM optimization

**Date:** 2025-03-04T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Anna Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/llm-optimization-online-experimentation


**Summary:**  
This article presents a systematic framework for online A/B testing of LLM applications, focusing onprompt engineering, model selection, and temperature tuning. Example: ## Experiment design and statistical rigor
### Hypothesis and goal
Define a measurable hypothesis: e.g., “Adding an example to the prompt will increase correct answer rates by 5%.” This clarity guides your metrics and success criteria. By isolating and experimenting with specific factors, teams can generate tangible improvements in performance, user engagement, and cost-efficiency.


**Key Points:**

- Improve performance: Validate hypothesis-driven changes (like new prompts) directly with real users.

- Reduce costs: Pinpoint “good enough” model variants or narrower context windows that maintain quality while lowering expenses.

- Boost engagement: Track user behaviors such as conversation length, retention, or click-through rates to ensure AI experiences resonate with users.

- Randomized user allocation: Users are split—often 50/50—so each group experiences only one variant. Randomization ensures a fair comparison.

- Single variable isolation: If testing a new prompt, keep the model and temperature consistent across both variants to attribute outcome differences to prompt changes.

- A different base model (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5).

- A refined prompt with new instructions or examples.

- Altered parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p).

### 38. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Vercel Native Integration

**Date:** 2025-02-27T07:00-12:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-vercel-native-integration


**Summary:**  
Modern web development depends on a seamless experience for users and developers. Performant, fast, and reliable websites are table stakes for users in 2025.At the same time, websites and applications are becoming increasingly complex, with more features, integrations, and components contributing to the user experience. Example: For example, if you're introducing a new navigation layout, you can first enable the flag for internal users, gather feedback, and then gradually roll it out to production—all without pushing a new deployment. No developer wants to manage extra configurations, third-party dashboards, or custom integrations, and no user wants to see a page flicker on load, or experience another 100ms wait until the page renders.


**Key Points:**

- Create and manage feature flagsto control your releases

- Run experimentsto test changes and measure impact

- Gain access to Analytics, Session Replay, and other Statsig product toolsthat don’t exist natively in your Vercel dashboard

- Use Statsig’s SDKs and Edge Config syncingfor low-latency performance without additional setup

- Install the integration:Find Statsig in the Vercel Marketplace and complete the quick setup flow

- Choose a billing plan:Both plans offer generous limits: theFree tierincludes 2M events/month, while thePro tierprovides 5M events/month for just $150

- Install Statsig and connect your Statsig project: Link your Statsig project to Vercel to sync feature flags, experiments, settings, permissions, etc.

- Initialize with Vercel’s Flags SDK or Statsig's SDK:We recommend using Vercel's Flags SDK for Next.js and SvelteKit projects; use Statsig’s SDK for all other projects

### 39. How to think about the relationship between correlation and causation

**Date:** 2025-02-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/correlation-vs-causation-guide


**Summary:**  
Yet, people still confuse correlation with causation all the time. Example: For example, this upsell that claims “4x” profile views as promised by LinkedIn Premium is definitely more correlation than causation. The trouble starts when people try to lock down a specific metric or target, like the famous claim thatadding more than 10 friends in 7 days is the key to Facebook’s engagement.


**Key Points:**

- Spot most cases of confusionbetween correlation and causation and form a clear idea of where the errors might come from.

- Grasp the essence of causal inference modelsbased on observed data. You’ll see exactly when their assumptions hold and when they don’t.

- Fifteen-year-old children who took the pill grew an average of 3 inches in one year.

- In the same schools, fifteen-year-old children who didnottake the pill grew an average of 2 inches in one year.

- Families with more money can afford the pill and give their kids better nutrition.

- Families who choose the pill care more about healthy growth and use other measures.

- Families who opt for the pill have shorter kids to begin with, so they show more “catch-up” growth.

- Most of us have heard the phrase “correlation isn’t causation.”

### 40. What are guardrail metrics in A/B tests?

**Date:** 2025-02-26T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Michael Makris  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-are-guardrail-metrics-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Your team designed the feature well, you set ambitious business targets, you built the feature well, and designed a solid A/B test to measure the results. Example: For example, if you're testing a new user interface, your primary metric might be the click-through rate on a feature button. While you aim to improve specific aspects of your product through A/B testing, you shouldn’t compromise on the overall system and business health.


**Key Points:**

- Ensuring that gains in one area do not cause losses in another

- Providing a holistic view of the impact of your tests

- Interactions with other features

- Envision the following:

- Introduction to guardrail metrics in A/B testing

- Primary metrics vs. guardrail metrics

- Not just for mistakes

- Real-world examples

### 41. How Statsig uses query-level experiments to speed up Metrics Explorer

**Date:** 2025-02-20T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Nicole Smith  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/query-level-experiments-metrics-explorer


**Summary:**  
Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. However, when we’re making performance improvements to Metrics Explorer queries, we’re less concerned with a stable user experience for experimentation purposes, and more concerned with making them faster in every scenario.


**Key Points:**

- More funnel steps: When there are more funnel steps, the size of the temp table or CTE in question is more likely to be larger.

- Grouping by a field: This tends to make subsequent steps in the query more expensive, so having using a temp table may be more efficient when a group by is in place.

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

- The implementation

- Handling assignment

- Query event telemetry

### 50. Stratified sampling in A/B Tests

**Date:** 2025-01-28T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/stratified-sampling-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Stratified sampling might just be the tool you need to bring clarity and precision to yourA/B testing efforts. Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison. This approach not only improves the quality of your data but also deepens your understanding of how different segments interact with your product.


**Key Points:**

- Identify key covariates: Look at past data to see which demographics or behaviors link closely with the changes you’re testing.

- Categorize your users: Group them by these identified covariates. This ensures each category is tested.

- Imagine you're running experiments to fine-tune your product, but your results swing wildly in every experiment you run.

- Introduction to stratified sampling in A/B testing

- Designing stratified samples for A/B tests

- Implementing stratified sampling in A/B tests

- Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison.

### 51. The ultimate guide to building an internal feature flagging system

**Date:** 2025-01-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
“Why do people pay for this?”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions. Example: You’re also likely to find some synergies in the code you write across these two services - for example, the service that provides evaluated flag values to clients can borrow logic from the code that evaluates rulesets on your servers, provided they’re written in the same language. - Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?


**Key Points:**

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

- Handle targeting on any user trait, like app version, country, IP address, etc.?

- Have extremely high uptime?

- test a feature in production (by “gating” it to only employees/ beta testers)

- rollout a feature to only certain geographies (by “gating” on user countries)

- run an A/B test (by gating a feature to a random 50% of userIDs)

- Or Run acanary release(release a feature to a random 10% of userIDs, to check that it doesn’t break anything)

### 52. Understanding (and reducing) variance and standard deviation

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:01-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-and-reducing-variance-and-standard-deviation


**Summary:**  
But uncertainty is an inevitability, and it's useful to be able to quantify it. Example: For example, if the standard deviation in our a/b test was close to infinity,anyobservation would be reasonably likely to occur by chance . - If we take a population of 10000 users, split them into even groups, and give half a treatment and half a placebo, we can use standard deviation to evaluate if the treatment did anything.


**Key Points:**

- Assume there is no treatment effect

- Measure our outcome metric

- Calculate the standard deviations of the populations’ metric, and the difference in mean metric values between the two groups

- Calculate the probability of observing that difference in means, given the standard deviation/spread of the population metric

- Variance is the average of squared differences from the mean. For each observation, we subtract the mean, multiply the result by itself, and then add all of those values up

- Standard deviation is the square root of the variance in the population

- Standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of observations

### 53. Detecting interaction effects of concurrent experiments

**Date:** 2025-01-13T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Kane Luo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/interaction-effect-detection


**Summary:**  
To accelerate experimentation, medium to large companies run hundreds of A/B tests simultaneously, aiming to isolate and measure the impact of each change, also known as the "main effect."
However, when multiple tests target the same area of your product, they can influence one another, resulting in either overestimation or underestimation of metric changes. Example: For example, to understand the effect of dark mode without the transition animation, you would compare group C to group A using a standard two-sample t-test. This expands the UI compatibility and aims to improve retention.


**Key Points:**

- Relaunch the same experimentsto a mutually exclusive audience. This is especially useful if you need more statistical power particularly on secondary metrics.

- Conduct manual statistical testsand determine which one of the two features to ship.

- If the interaction is synergistic, you candouble down on the combined experience, by either launching a new test or analyzing group A and D.

- Rework the experienceto make the feature compatible.

- Statsig now offersinteraction effect detectionto uncover the hidden effects of experiments on each other.

- Scenario: Dark mode gone wrong

- How do we diagnose it?

- My experiments are interacting—now what?

### 55. How to report test results

**Date:** 2025-01-02T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-report-test-results


**Summary:**  
Now comes the critical moment—communicating your insights to your company’s stakeholders. Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups. Analysts may prematurely generalize sample results to the population, leading to overly definitive claims such as, “This feature will increase revenue by 10%” or “The conversion rate in the new version improved by 5%.”
How to get it right: When communicating test results, it’s crucial to remember that your data reflects what happens in your sample and may not precisely represent the population.


**Key Points:**

- Secondary KPIs: For secondary KPIs, summarize the results visually or in a table that includes the uplift, the boundaries of the confidence interval, and the p-value.

- 1. Overstating certainty

- 2. Confusing Test Settings with Test Results

- 3. Misinterpreting p-values

- 4. Misinterpreting confidence interval

- 5. Ignoring external validity

- An example: Report of test’s results

- Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups.

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/key-problems-in-d2c-that-experimentation-solves


**Summary:**  
“Half your ideas will fail… you need to verify and tweak your ideas until they actually deliver value for the customer.”
– Wyatt Thompson, Dollar Shave Club
## Why D2C brands face unique challenges
Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands thrive by forging direct relationships with customers—yet this also makes them vulnerable to every friction point along the user journey. Example: For example, small tweaks to the timing or format of promotional emails can reduce churn and encourage repeat purchases within 28 days. keyword-based) or surface trending bundles (“Complete the look”) to see which approach not only increases product visibility but also boosts average order value.


**Key Points:**

- For direct-to-consumer brands, data-driven testing is the real game-changer.

### 59. One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/one-tailed-vs-two-tailed-tests


**Summary:**  
If your answer is no—or if you’re not even sure what this means—then this blog is for you! Example: Reviewing the previous graph can help illustrate this: for example, a result in the left tail might be significant under a two-tailed hypothesis but not under a right one-tailed hypothesis. Note that the purple area is larger for the one-tailed hypothesis, compared to the two-tailed hypothesis:
In practice, to maintain the desired power level, we compensate for the reduced power of a two-tailed hypothesis by increasing the sample size (Increasing sample size raises power, though the mechanics of this can be a topic for a separate article).


**Key Points:**

- One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Hypothesis Testing: Understanding the Difference

- Why does it make a difference?

- How to decide between one-tailed and two-tailed hypothesis?

### 60. You don&#39;t need large sample sizes to run A/B tests

**Date:** 2024-12-12T03:15+00:00  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/you-dont-need-large-sample-sizes-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Yet many small and medium-sized companies aren’t running A/B Tests. Example: Google routinely runs large search tests on a massive scale, for example 100,000,000 users where a+0.1% effect on topline metrics is a big win. A/B testing is a pillar of data-driven product development irrespective of the product’s size
### Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing
Startup companies have a major advantage in experimentation:huge potential and upside.Startups don’t play the micro-optimization game; they don’t care about a +0.2% increase in click-through rates.

**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-rollouts-examples


**Summary:**  
Instagram was becoming the primary medium for keeping tabs on friends and influencers alike—perceiving the world through their iPhone lenses, in a way. Example: Take Spotify Wrapped, for example. I’m not sure if it was always meant to be a temporary feature, or if it simply didn’t increase the metrics that Meta had hoped.


**Key Points:**

- Just got fired from my job:Thankful🌸

- Looking for carpenter recommendations:Thankful🌸

- A compilation of Mark Zuckerberg talking about barbecue sauce:Thankful🌸

- This thankful react thing needs to stop:Thankful🌸

- Tag Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post

- Sign up for my random newsletter

- Feature flags: Toggle switches for system behavior/features in production that allow for gradual rollouts, A/B testing, kill switches, etc.

- Holdouts: Used to measure the cumulative impact of feature releases and check if wins are sustained over time.

### 64. How A/B testing platforms make data science more interesting

**Date:** 2024-10-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-ab-testing-platforms-make-data-science-more-interesting


**Summary:**  
A/B testing platforms have become highly efficient, automating much of the mundane work involved in setting up, calculating, and reporting on experiments. Example: "An engineer that improves server performance by ten milliseconds more than pays for his or her fully loaded annual costs."
Illustrating the tangible impact of small improvements, Kohavi shared this powerful example. ## Excerpts
"Most experiments fail to improve the metrics they were designed to improve."
Kohavi highlighted a counterintuitive reality: the majority of experiments don't yield the expected positive results.


**Key Points:**

- What’s the current state of experimentation automation since the release of the Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (the "Hippo" book)?

- How does this automation impact the role of data scientists?

- What should data scientists focus on moving forward?

- How can we secure leadership buy-in for experimentation efforts?

- Over the past few years, the data science landscape has fundamentally changed.

**Date:** 2024-10-09T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimental-meta-analysis-and-knowledge-base


**Summary:**  
Over the past three years, we’ve seen several companies significantly scale their experimentation culture, often increasing their experimentation velocity by 10-30x within a year. Example: For example, if you’ve spent a quarter testing ways to optimize product recommendations in your e-commerce app, an individual experiment might guide a ship decision. Whatnot hit a run rate of 400 experiments last year,Notion scaled from single-digit to hundreds per quarter,Rec Room went from nearly zero to 150 experimentsin their first year with Statsig, andLime started testing every change they roll out.


**Key Points:**

- What experiments are running now?

- When are they expected to end?

- What % of experiments ship Control vs Test?

- What is the typical duration?

- Do experiments run for their planned duration or much longer or shorter?

- Do experiments impact key business metrics or only shallow or team-level metrics?

- How much do they impact key business metrics?

- The value of experimentation compounds as you run more experiments.

### 70. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Example: Funnels allow you to measure complex relationships with a higher degree of clarity.For example, you see revenue flatten, but product page views are going up. If you care about improving your checkout flow for products, tracking this data at a session level is more powerful, measuring (successes / tries) instead of (successful users / users who tried)
Consider when a user vs.


**Key Points:**

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- Statistical rigor:Make sure funnel conversions have the delta method applied and have sound practices for ordinal logic.

- Ordered events:For funnels to be really useful, you should be able to specify that users do events in a specific sequence over time.

- Multiple-step funnels:Two-step funnels can be useful, but the ability to add intermediate steps as needed for richer understanding is critical.

- Step-level and overall conversion changes:This is how you can identifywheredrop-offs happen.

- Calculation windows:Being able to specify the maximum duration a user has to finish a funnel is critical to running longer experiments.

**Date:** 2024-09-15T00:00-05:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped


**Summary:**  
MeaningControlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data, CUPED is frequently cited as—and used as—one of the most powerful algorithmic tools for increasing the speed and accuracy of experimentation programs. Example: In the example below, it’s pretty obvious that the difference in the groupsbeforethe test would make the results extremely skewed:
You might note that you can see that the weighted runners’ times went up, and the unweighted runners’ times went down. In this article, we’ll:
- Cover the background of CUPED
Cover the background of CUPED
- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
## What CUPED solves:
As an experiment matures and hits its target date for readout, it’s not uncommon to see a result that seems to beonly barelyoutside the range where it would be treated as statistical


**Key Points:**

- Cover the background of CUPED

- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED

- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments

- The effect size in our T-test (the delta between test and control) is exactly the same as the “test” variable’s coefficient in the OLS regression.

- The standard error for the coefficient is the same as the standard error for our T-test.

- The p-value for the “test” variable coefficient is the same as for our t-test!

- Our p-value goes from 0.116 to 0.000 because of the decreased Standard Error. The result, which was previously not statistically significant, is now clearly significant.

- Multiply the pre-experiment population mean byθand add it to each user’s result

### 72. I want it that way: Building experimentation infrastructure and culture with Ronny Kohavi 

**Date:** 2024-09-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Morgan Scalzo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-experimentation-infrastructure-and-culture-ronny-kohavi


**Summary:**  
We recently hosted a virtual meetup featuring Allon Korem, CEO ofBell, and Ronny Kohavi, awidely respected thought leaderand expert in experimentation. Example: For example, a p-value of 0.01 does not mean there is a 99% chance of success. - Experimentation culture: Establishing an organizational culture that embraces experimentation is vital for continuous growth and improvement.


**Key Points:**

- Case study: Only 12% of 1,000 experiments succeeded, illustrating the harsh reality that many organizations must accept—a high failure rate is normal.

- Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches: They covered the differences between these two statistical approaches and their applications in experimentation.

- A/A tests as best practice: RunningA/A testsis strongly recommended to validate experimentation setups and ensure the reliability of testing infrastructure.

- Asymmetric allocation: This approach can provide advantages to the larger group in an experiment, optimizing for specific outcomes.

- You can always learn something from people with lots of experience.

- Key insights from Ronny Kohavi

- Should every organization aim for "fly" in every category?

- Discussion on failures

**Date:** 2024-09-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/meta-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
I wanted to show my data scientist audience how powerful Deltoid is, yet was prohibited from doing so as it’s an internal tool. Example: For example, inan earlier video, I discussed how AB testing shapes the meritocracy and competitive culture at Facebook. We found thatthe white background caused a decrease in click-through rate and conversion rate:It made users feel like they were in a traditional e-commerce experience, rather than browsing for deals.


**Key Points:**

- I recordedStatsig’s first public demoover three years ago.

- Measuring our failure

- Understanding our failure

- The difference a white background can make

- The counterfactual of no A/B testing

- Get started now!

**Summary:**  
And neither were the passengers of Alaska Airlines flight 1282, whose emergency exit door fell out in January, forcing the pilot of the Boeing 737 Max to conduct an emergency landing. Example: Steve Hafner, the CEO of Kayak, goes on to say, “While the overall fraction of users filtering the 737 remains small, usage increased following the Alaska Airlines incident in January(15x compared to month prior from a low baseline), and it has since decreased until this past week (to 10x compared to Dec 2023).”

### 76. Technical insights to a scalable experimentation system

**Date:** 2024-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/technical-insights-to-a-scalable-experimentation-system


**Summary:**  
(2022)highlighted, establishing trust in experimental results is challenging. Example: For example, a differential baseline between groups prior to a treatment is not statistically biased, but it is undesirable for making business decisions and usually requires resetting the test. In such cases, the cost of maintaining more experiments increases super-linearly, while the benefits increase sub-linearly.


**Key Points:**

- Historical Relevance:Experiments serve both decision-making and learning purposes, requiring a comprehensive understanding of both current and past experiments.

- Managerial incentives often encourage detrimental behaviors, such as p-hacking.

- Experiments may result in technical debt by leaving configurations within the codebase.

- The marginal return of experiments increases linearly or sub-linearly with scale, as less effort is available to turn information into impact.

- The marginal cost of experiments increases super-linearly with scale due to information and managerial overhead.

- Default-on experiments on all new features.

- Define metrics once, use everywhere.

- Reliable, traceable, and transparent data.

### 78. Why the uplift in A/B tests often differs from real-world results

**Date:** 2024-08-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-the-uplift-in-a-b-tests-often-differs-from-real-world


**Summary:**  
This disconnect can be puzzling and disappointing, especially when decisions and expectations are built around these tests. Example: A common example I’ve encountered with clients involves tests that yield inconclusive (non-significant) results. While reducing the significance level can decrease the number of false positives, it would also require longer test durations, which may not always be feasible.


**Key Points:**

- Human bias in analysis and interpretation

- False positives

- Sequential testing and overstated effect sizes

- Novelty effect and user behavior

- External validity and real-world factors

- Limited exposure in testing

- Strategies for mitigating discrepancies

- Get started now!

### 79. How to pick metrics that make or break your experiments (including do&#39;s and don&#39;ts)

**Date:** 2024-08-14T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Elizabeth George  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-metrics-that-make-or-break-your-experiments


**Summary:**  
In fact, the wrong metrics can not only mislead your results but can also derail your entire strategy.


**Key Points:**

- Have a razor-sharp focus on one primary behavioral metric and a clearly aligned business metric.

- Anticipate and measure the negative consequences of your changes—because they’re inevitable.

- Use secondary metrics to fill in the gaps in your understanding. Without them, you’re operating in the dark.

- Ensure your experiment has enough power to provide conclusive, reliable results. Anything less is a waste of time.

- Stick with the same business metric for every experiment. If it doesn’t align with your specific goals, it’s irrelevant.

- Overcomplicate your analysis with a laundry list of metrics. Clarity and focus are your allies; distraction is your enemy.

- Over-interpret secondary data. If it’s not part of your primary hypothesis, it’s noise—don’t let it lead you astray.

- Your experiments are only as good as the metrics you choose.

### 80. How to plan test duration when using CUPED

**Date:** 2024-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-plan-test-duration-cuped


**Summary:**  
You understand that failing to plan the test duration can lead to underpowered tests and inflated false positive rates due to peeking. Example: Example:
In reality, we don't know the true values of the variables, so we must estimate them. Recently, you've been introduced toCUPED, an advanced statistical method that reduces KPI variance, resulting in more sensitive tests (lower MDE) or shorter test durations (lower sample size).


**Key Points:**

- Calculate the Non-CUPED Sample Size: Use the regular t-test sample size formula.

- Adjust Sample Size: Reduce the calculated sample size by the factor of \(\rho^2\).

- Suppose the non-CUPED sample size is 1000.

- Historical sampled data shows an estimated Pearson correlation of 0.9 between \(X\) and \(Y\).

- Calculate the variance reduction factor: \(0.9^2 = 0.81\).

- Adjust the sample size: \(1000 \times (1 - 0.81) = 190\).

- What is test planning and why is it important?

### 83. Hypothesis Testing explained in 4 parts

**Date:** 2024-07-22T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-explained


**Summary:**  
As data scientists, Hypothesis Testing is expected to be well understood, but often not in reality. It is mainly because our textbooks blend two schools of thought – p-value and significance testing vs. Example: For example, some questions are not obvious unless you have thought through them before:
- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis? Third, to illustrate the two concepts concisely, let’s run a visualization by just changing the sample size from 30 to 100 and see how power increases from 86.3% to almost 100%.


**Key Points:**

- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis?

- Can we accept the null hypothesis? Why?

- How does MDE change with alpha holding beta constant?

- Why do we use standard error in Hypothesis Testing but not the standard deviation?

- Why can’t we be specific about the alternative hypothesis so we can properly model it?

- Why is the fundamental tradeoff of the Hypothesis Testing about mistake vs. discovery, not about alpha vs. beta?

- We emphasize a clear distinction between the standard deviation and the standard error, and why the latter is used in Hypothesis Testing

- We explain fully when can you “accept” a hypothesis, when shall you say “failing to reject” instead of “accept”, and why

### 84. Top 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them

**Date:** 2024-07-18T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/top-8-common-experimentation-mistakes-how-to-fix


**Summary:**  
I recently down with Allon Korem, CEO ofBell Statistics, and Tyler VanHaren, Software Engineer at Statsig, to discuss some of the most frequent mistakes companies can make in A/B testing and experimentation! I've summarized the discussion and outlined the 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them. By addressing these common testing mistakes, companies can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of their A/B tests.


**Key Points:**

- Data integrity:Ensure that your allocation point is consistent and verify your distributions using chi-squared tests to detect sample ratio mismatches.

- Skepticism and Vigilance:Regularly check data integrity over different segments and time periods to identify inconsistencies early.

- Proper Metrics:Collaborate with data science teams to ensure metrics are correctly defined and measured, focusing on meaningful business-driven KPIs.

- Statistical Methods:Use t-tests for means and z-tests for proportions in most cases. Ensure your statistical tests are relevant to your hypotheses.

- Peeking:Use sequential testing approaches to manage peeking. Tools like Statsig provide inflated confidence intervals for early data to mitigate premature conclusions.

- Underpowered Tests:Plan tests meticulously using power analysis calculators to ensure you have sufficient data to detect the expected changes.

- Handling Outliers:Use Windsorization to cap extreme values rather than removing outliers entirely, maintaining the integrity of your data.

- Cultural Challenges:Foster a culture that encourages upfront hypothesis formulation and continuous learning from experimentation.

### 85. Introducing Differential Impact Detection 

**Date:** 2024-07-17T09:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/differential-impact-detection


**Summary:**  
Statsig can now automatically surface heterogenous treatment effects across your user properties. In experimentation “one size fits all” is not always true. Example: For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users. For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users.


**Key Points:**

- Investigate the top sub-populations across each user property that you specify as a “Segment of Interest”

- For each primary metric in the experiment, determine if any sub-population has a different response to treatment

- Automatically surface a visualization of metrics sliced by user segments where one or more sub-population behaves significantly differently from the rest of the population

- Apply Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparison (check implementation details at the end)

- Concise Summarization of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Using Total Variation Regularized Regression

- Online Controlled Experiments: Introduction, Pitfalls, and Scaling(see pitfall 6: failing to look at segments)

- What are Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and why do we care?

- How does our feature help solve this

### 86. Identifying and experimenting with Power Users using Statsig

**Date:** 2024-07-16T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Mike London   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/identifying-experimenting-power-users-statsig


**Summary:**  
For most companies, power users are the driving force behind the success of many digital products, wielding significant influence and engagement compared to the average user. They are not only highly active and skilled with the features of a product, but they also often serve as brand ambassadors, providing valuable feedback and promoting the product within their networks. Example: - For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months. - For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months.

### 87. How to Ingest Data Into Statsig

**Date:** 2024-07-16T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Logan Bates  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-ingest-data-into-statsig


**Summary:**  
During my endeavors as a data engineer, I’d spend hours helping teams translate data models and building data pipelines between software tools so they could effectively communicate. The frustration of getting the data into tools often spoiled the intended initial experience and added complexities to a production implementation. Event filters can be utilized to reduce downstream event volume to Statsig, so only your relevant metrics are analyzed.


**Key Points:**

- Access to your data source (e.g., data warehouse, 3rd party data tool/CDP, or application code).

- Necessary permissions to read from and write to your data source. (if applicable)

- Familiarity with SQL (if you're using a data warehouse)

- Use thelogEventmethod in various languages to quickly populate Statsig with data for experimentation and analysis

- Log additional metrics alongside 3rd party or internal logging systems to enhance measurement capabilities

- Use in situations where the SDKs are not supported or preferred

- Can be used to support custom metric ingestion workflows

- Quickly populate Statsig with metric data and analyze with themetrics explorer

### 88. Product experimentation best practices

**Date:** 2024-07-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-experimentation-best-practices


**Summary:**  
A good design document eliminates much of the ambiguity and uncertainty often encountered in the analysis and decision-making stages. Example: For example:
- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
### Power analysis, allocation, and duration
Allocation
This is the percentage of the user base that will be eligible for this experiment. These often include:
- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Se


**Key Points:**

- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)

- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)

- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric

- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs

- Running concurrent, mutually exclusive experiments requires allocating a fraction of the user base to each experiment.  On Statsig this is handled withLayers.

- A smaller allocation may be preferable for high-risk experiments, especially when the overall user base is large enough.

- For guardrail metrics: The MDE should be the largest regression size you’re willing to miss and ship unknowingly.

- Use power analysis to determine the duration needed to reach the MDE for each the those primary metrics. If they yield different results, pick the longest one.

### 90. Understanding significance levels: A key to accurate data analysis

**Date:** 2024-07-03  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-significance-levels-a-key-to-accurate-data-analysis


**Summary:**  
In this post, we provide an introduction to significance levels, what they are, and why they are important for data analysis. Example: For example, let's say you're comparing two versions of a feature using an A/B test. A lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) reduces the risk offalse positivesbut increases the risk of false negatives.


**Key Points:**

- P-values don't measure the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false.

- A statistically significant result doesn't necessarily imply practical significance or importance.

- The significance level (α) is not the probability of making a Type I error (false positive).

- In fields like medicine or aviation, where false positives can have severe consequences, a lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) may be more appropriate.

- For exploratory studies or when false negatives are more problematic, a higher significance level (e.g., 0.10) might be justified.

- P-values don't provide information about themagnitude or practical importanceof an effect.

- Focusing exclusively on p-values can lead to thefile drawer problem, where non-significant results are less likely to be published, creating a biased literature.

- P-values are influenced by sample size; large samples can yield statistically significant results for small, practically unimportant effects.

**Date:** 2024-06-25T12:15-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/warehouse-native-year-in-review


**Summary:**  
Since then, Warehouse Native has grown into a core product for us; we treat it with the same priority as Statsig Cloud, and have developed the two products to share core infrastructure, methodology, and design philosophies. Example: - More tools in the warehouse; for example, we have a beta version ofMetrics Explorerfor warehouse native customers and are excited to continue developing this - sharing a metric definition language between quick metric explorations and advanced statistical calculations helps bridge the gap between exploratory work and rigorous measurement. One of the competitive advantages we think Statsig has is “clock speed” - we just build faster than other teams building the same thing.


**Key Points:**

- Willingness - and internal/external alignment - to ship things that were functional-but-ugly

- Letting the development team play to their strengths

- Treating early customers like team members

- An Engineering “Code Machine” - someone who could crank out quality code twice as fast as other engineers

- A PM “Tech Lead” - someone who leads efforts across the company

- A DS “Product Hybrid” - someone who bridges product and engineering to solve complex business problems

- A year ago, Statsig announced Warehouse Native, bringing our experimentation platform into customers’ Data Warehouses.

- Why warehouse native?

**Date:** 2024-05-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kevin-anderson-vista-fireside-chat


**Summary:**  
Last week, I hosted Kevin Anderson (Product Manager, Experimentation at Vista) for a candid fireside chat filled with interesting anecdotes and tips for building an experimentation-driven product culture. He argued that you can't improve quality unless you're already running numerous experiments.


**Key Points:**

### 100. How to debug your experiments and feature rollouts

**Date:** 2024-05-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-debug-your-experiments-and-feature-rollouts


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a product manager, or a software engineer, you know that even the most meticulously planned test rollout can encounter unexpected hiccups. Example: Statsig also allows you to override specific users, for example, if you wanted to test your feature with employees first in production. Statsig also offersstratified sampling; When experimenting on a user base where a tail-end of power users drive a large portion of an overall metric value, stratified sampling meaningfully reduces false positive rates and makes your results more consistent and trustworthy.


**Key Points:**

- Inadequate sampling: A sample that's too small or not representative of an evenly weighted distribution can lead to inconclusive or misleading results.

- Lack of confidence in metrics: Without trustworthy success metrics, it's harder to determine how to make a decision.

- User exposure issues: If users aren't exposed to the experiment as intended, your data won't reflect their true behavior.

- Biased experiments: Running multiple experiments that affect the same variables can contaminate your results.

- Technical errors: Bugs in the code can introduce unexpected variables that impact the experiment's outcome.

- Success criteria: Before launching an experiment, it's crucial to define how you’re measuring success. Make these metrics readily available for analysis.

- Running experiments mutually exclusively: To prevent experiments from influencing each other, consider using feature flagging frameworks.

- When it comes to digital experimentation and feature rollouts, the devil is often in the details.

### 101. Introducing Experiment Templates: Streamline your A/B testing

**Date:** 2024-05-21T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experiment-templates-streamline-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
When you’re running experiments at scale, experiment setup can often be time-consuming and repetitive, especially when you're running multiple tests across different features or products. Experiment Templates are designed to help this by:
- Reducing setup time: Get your experiments up and running faster, so you can iterate and learn at a quicker pace.


**Key Points:**

- Standardize metrics: Define a set of core metrics that are automatically included in every experiment, ensuring you always measure what matters most.

- Replicate success: Use the settings from your most impactful experiments as a starting point for new tests.

- Collaborate efficiently: Share templates with your team to align on methodologies and accelerate onboarding for new experimenters.

- Navigate to the Templates tab: Within your project settings, you'll find the option to manage your templates.

- Create from scratch or templatize an existing Experiment: Start with a blank slate or convert an existing experiment into a template with just a few clicks.

- Define your blueprint: Set up your metrics, feature flags, and any other configurations you want to standardize.

- Save and share: Once you're happy with your template, save it and make it available to your team.

- Reducing setup time: Get your experiments up and running faster, so you can iterate and learn at a quicker pace.

### 102. How to track your features&#39; retention

**Date:** 2024-05-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-track-your-features-retention


**Summary:**  
The most common use of retention metrics that you’re familiar with, when A and B are the same action over different time periods T0 and T1, is just a special case of this more generalized definition. Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage. For example, day-of-week seasonality can be aggregated away by setting T0 and T1 to be 7 days in duration and measuring retention on a weekly cadence.


**Key Points:**

- Choosing appropriate A, B, T0, and T1

- The specificity vs sample size trade-off (choosing A)

- When repeated feature usage is more/less meaningful (choosing B)

- Evaluating useful time ranges (choosing T0, T1, and how many retention data points to generate)

- Using Metrics Explorer on Statsig to track feature retention

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage.

**Date:** 2024-04-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-experiments-beginners-guide


**Summary:**  
Traditionally, A/B testing has been dominated by Frequentist statistics, which rely on p-values and confidence intervals to make decisions. - Prior information is available: If you have reliable historical data or expert knowledge, Bayesian experiments can use that information to improve the accuracy of the results.


**Key Points:**

- Small sample sizes: When you have limited data, Bayesian methods can be more robust since they can leverage prior information to make up for the lack of data.

- Sequential analysis: Bayesian experiments are well-suited for situations where you want to look at the results continuously and potentially stop the test early.

- Complex models: If you're dealing with complex models or multiple metrics, Bayesian methods can help manage the intricacies more effectively.

- Prior information is available: If you have reliable historical data or expert knowledge, Bayesian experiments can use that information to improve the accuracy of the results.

- Flexibility: Bayesian experiments can be updated continuously as new data comes in, making them well-suited for dynamic environments where conditions change rapidly.

- Clear decision-making: With Bayesian testing, you can quantify the risk associated with a decision, such as the expected loss if a new feature underperforms.

- A Statsig account with access to the experiments feature.

- A clear hypothesis and defined metrics for your experiment.

### 122. Novelty effects: Everything you need to know

**Date:** 2024-03-20T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/novelty-effects


**Summary:**  
Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness. Example: For example, feature level funnel, and feature level retention, can tell us whether users finished using the feature as we intended and whether they come back to the feature. Imagine this – the restaurant you pass by every day had a 100% improvement on their menu, their chef and their services.


**Key Points:**

- Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness.

- Not all products have novelty effects. They exist mostly in high-frequency products.

- Ignoring the temporary nature of novelty effects may lead to incorrect product decisions, and worse, bad culture.

- The most effective way to find novelty effects and control them is to examinethe time series of treatment effects.

- The root cause solution is to use a set of metrics that correctly represent user intents.

- When understood and used correctly, novelty effects can help you.

- Novelty effects are part of the treatment effects, so there is no statistical method to detect them generically

- Novelty effects are dangerous and will spread if you don’t combat them

### 123. How to monitor the long term effects of your experiment

**Date:** 2024-03-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-monitor-the-long-term-effects-of-your-experiment


**Summary:**  
Now, imagine discovering six months later that it actually reduced long-term retention. Example: Let's get practical with an example from Statsig.


**Key Points:**

- User behavior is unpredictable: Users might initially react positively to a new feature but lose interest over time.

- External factors: Events outside your control, such as a global pandemic, can drastically alter user engagement and skew your experiment results.

- You then model these early signals against historical data of known long-term outcomes. This helps predict the eventual impact on retention.

- It's important to choose surrogate indexes wisely. They must have a proven correlation with the long-term outcome you care about.

- Engaged user biasmeans you're mostly hearing from your power users. They're not your average customer, so their feedback might lead you down a narrow path.

- Selective sampling issuesoccur when you only look at a subset of users. This might make you miss out on broader trends.

- Diversify your data sources: Don't rely solely on one type of user feedback. Look at a mix of both highly engaged users and those less active.

- Use stratified sampling: This means you'll divide your user base into smaller groups or strata based on characteristics like usage frequency. Then, sample evenly from these groups.

### 124. Demystifying identity resolution

**Date:** 2024-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/demystifying-identity-resolution


**Summary:**  
The notion of “identity resolution” in the SaaS world continues to be an elusive gold standard that businesses want to solve in order to understand the full scope of customer behaviors across all touch-points. Example: ## Example ID resolution scenarios
Scenario 1:An unknown user visits the website and gets assigned to the “Test” group fornav_v2experiment using via a deviceID.


**Key Points:**

- No technology providers will solve every use-case and scenario perfectly, though many will make bold claims. There is a ton of nuance here and no one-size-fits-all solution.

- It is strictly impossible to reliably identify a single human interacting anonymously on two different devices that never identify themselves.

- Unknown user identity becomes the crux of the challenge. When switching devices, browsers, environments (server vs. client), or clearing device storage, this ID will not persist.

- The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds.

- A few disclaimers, debunkings, and considerations as we dive in:

- Identity boundary basics

- What does this have to do with experimentation?

### 125. How much does a product analytics platform cost?

**Date:** 2024-03-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-much-does-a-product-analytics-platform-cost


**Summary:**  
Pricing for analytics is rarely transparent. Example: For example, Amplitude Plus comes with Feature Flags, CDP capabilities, and Session Replay.


**Key Points:**

- Amplitude Growth starts in the middle of the pack but spikes around 10M events / month (when our model means a customer crosses 200K MTUs).

- Statsig is consistently the least expensive throughout the curve. In case you think we’re biased, pleasecheck our work!

- When you’re buying a product analytics platform, it’s hard to know if you’re getting good value.

- Assumptions about pricing

- Other things to consider

- Closing thoughts

### 129. Ad blockers&#39; impact on your feature management and testing tools

**Date:** 2023-11-16T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ad-blockers-feature-management-testing-tools


**Summary:**  
There are many browser extensions out there today available to web users that help them block pesky ads around the web.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig’s presence on the block lists is less than other providers at the time of writing this, likely due to the fact that we were founded more recently—but this could change!

- Users with privacy blockers may wish to not be tracked at all, in which case it is best to respect that preference!

- According to new research, somewhere around40% of global internet users employ some form of ad-blocking technology.

### 130. Onboarding for growth with A/B tests

**Date:** 2023-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/onboarding-for-growth-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
For B2B SaaS applications, a user’s very first login or download experience has a significant influence on their engagement metrics. Example: Example experiment hypothesis: Tooltip pop-ups at every screen might empower users to progress through the onboarding workflow, thereby increasing the percentage of onboarding completions and subsequently active usage. The quicker you guide them to this revelation (decrease time-to-value), the more likely they are to become sticky, which significantly impacts core metrics such as daily active users (DAU) and ultimately retention and net recurring revenue (NRR).


**Key Points:**

- Incorporating contextual tooltips or pop-ups that empower users to navigate through the workflow (sometimes even including a brief autoplay tutorial)

- Highlighting specific high-value feature(s) that give early wins for users

- Featuring a “one-click quick start” or similar capability that automatically configures basic parameters for immediate use of features

- Offering different plans such as a free trial with limited features vs a premium trial with full access

- Personalizing messaging based on the user's persona such as their industry or role

- Offering discounts in the eleventh hour is not the growth strategy of champions.

- Successful onboarding-for-growth implementations

- Testing and identifying winning features

### 132. Lessons from Notion: How to build a great AI product, if you&#39;re not an AI company

**Date:** 2023-06-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/notion-how-to-build-an-ai-product


**Summary:**  
Imagine that you’re the CEO of a successful documents company. You know it’s time to build an AI product. Example: With the rate at which the AI space is changing, there will be constant opportunities to improve the AI product by:
- Swapping out models (i.e., replacing GPT-3.5-turbo with GPT-4)
Swapping out models (i.e., replacing GPT-3.5-turbo with GPT-4)
- Creating a new, purpose-built model (i.e., taking an open-source model and training it for your application)

### 133. Online experimentation: The new paradigm for building AI applications

**Date:** 2023-04-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Palak Goel and Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-products-require-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:
First, product managers would come up with a new idea for a product and lay out a release timeline. Example: But the risks are palpable—for every AI success story, there’s an example of a biased model sharing misinformation, or a feature being pulled due to safety concerns. #### In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today.


**Key Points:**

- How can you launch and iterate on features quickly without compromising your existing user experience?

- How can you move fast while ensuring your apps are safe and reliable?

- How can you ensure that the features you launch lead to substantive, differentiated improvements in user outcomes?

- How can you identify the optimal prompts and models for your specific use case?

- Build compelling AI features that engage users

- Flight dozens of models, prompts and parameters in the ‘back end’ of these features

- Collect data on all inputs and outputs

- Use this data to select the best-performing variant and fine-tune new models

### 135. Understanding the role of the 95% confidence interval

**Date:** 2022-08-04T16:31:57.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/95-percent-confidence-interval


**Summary:**  
Yet its validity and usefulness is often questioned. Example: For example, startup companies that have a high risk tolerance will want to minimize false negatives by selecting lower confidence intervals (e.g., 80% or 90%). I’m a proponent of 95%confidence intervalsand recommend them as a solid default.


**Key Points:**

- A range of plausible values

- An indicator of how repeatable/stable our experimental method is

- It’s a reasonable low bar.In practice, it’s an achievable benchmark for most fields of research to remain productive.

- It’s ubiquitous.It ensures we’re all speaking the same language. What one team within your company considers significant is the same as another team.

- Set your confidence threshold BEFORE any data is collected. Cheaters change the confidence interval after there’s an opportunity to peek.

- Gelman, Andrew (Nov. 5, 2016).“Why I prefer 50% rather than 95% intervals”.

- Gelman, Andrew (Dec 28, 2017).“Stupid-ass statisticians don’t know what a goddam confidence interval is”.

### 136. CUPED on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-07-07T21:55:42.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics. Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).


**Key Points:**

- The more stable a metric tends to be for the same user over time, the more CUPED can reduce variance and pre-experiment bias

- CUPED utilizespre-exposuredata for users, so experiments on new users or newly logged metrics won’t be able to leverage this technique

- Getting in the habit of setting up key metrics and starting to track metrics before an experiment starts will help you to get the most out of CUPED on Statsig

- Run experiments with more speed and accuracy

- How this will help you

- Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).

- Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/leading-a-team-of-lions


**Summary:**  
Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear.”
… wroteC.S. Example: Three working principles that I rely on heavily:
- Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
- Make it trivial to test a change with a small section of users, and progressively expand the blast radius; for example, start by dog-fooding features with internal employees, then open up to a small group customers, say, who asked for the feature, then expand more broadly

### 138. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Example: For example, if you typed “#m lgtm” the bot would respond with the macro lgtm, an image of a doge saying looks good to me. A few main reasons:
- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.


**Key Points:**

- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Within the Admin Panel -> Select Integrations -> Click Create custom integration

- Within Permissions, check “Group chat bot”, “Message any member”, and “Read all messages”

- You should get back a url that looks like this:http://71c8-216-207-142-218.ngrok.io. Input that as the callback url in the page webhook.

- Open uphttp://localhost:4040/in your browser. Here is where you can see requests sent and received by your webhook.

- Create a new Workplace group chat with your favorite coworkers and your bot, and trigger your bot by calling one of your macros such as “#m lgtm”

- Usehttp://localhost:4040/and console to debug as needed

### 139. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
They’re trying several ideas at any given time. If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.


**Key Points:**

- Have a clear set of questions the holdout is designed to answer. This will guide your design, holdout duration, value you get and will dictate what costs make sense to incur.

- Understand the costs associated with holdouts. Make sure teams that will pay those costs understand holdout goals and buy in.

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Feature Level Holdouts

- Measuring Cumulative Impact

- If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.

### 142. Democratizing Experimentation

**Date:** 2022-03-21T05:41:41.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/democratizing-experimentation


**Summary:**  
When building out instant games on Facebook a few years back, a new developer switched to use a newer version of an internal SDK. Example: (once measures turn into goals, it’s possible to incent behavior that’s undesirable unless we’re prudent; see theHanoi Rat Problemfor an interesting example)
Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want? A more experienced teammate noticed the change reduced time spent in the game.


**Key Points:**

- Is the metric movement explainable?

- Are all significant movements being reported, not just the positive ones?

- Are guardrail metrics being violated?

- Is there a quota we’re drawing from?

- Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want?

- Guarding againstp-hacking (or selective reporting)(often by establishing guidelines like using ~14 day windows to report results over;see more about reading results safely here.)

- Amazon famously reduced distractions during checkout flows to improve conversion. This is a pattern that most ecommerce sites now optimize for.

- Experiment Review Best Practices

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/definitive-guide-ecommerce-growth


**Summary:**  
I’ve done it thrice, first with Flipkart, then with a company that I founded myself, then at Amazon. Example: For example, anA/B testfor checkout on the Vancouver Olympic Store showed that a single page checkout performed 21.8% better than the multi-step checkout. Large improvements deeper in the funnel require a smaller sample size to test and make every upstream step more effective.


**Key Points:**

- E-commerce is hard.

- 1. Optimizing Conversion Rate

- Crushing the Gloom of Cart Abandonment

- Lighting-up Add-to-Cart Conversions

- 2. Growing Visitors

**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/environments-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments. Example: The solution for this is to create rules explicitly for the Dev and Staging environments (like in the global config example above). It optimizes for engineering efficiency : reducing errors and making troubleshooting faster.


**Key Points:**

- Two philosophies : Per Environment Config vs Global Config

- Wrinkles (and mitigation)

- Example: The solution for this is to create rules explicitly for the Dev and Staging environments (like in the global config example above).

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. Example: Try plugging your pitch into this template:
“[company]helps customers[verb] [business outcome]by[tech capability].”
For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”
### 2. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel.


**Key Points:**

- Sales is all about process.

- 1. Nail your pitch

- 2. Don’t reinvent the wheel

- 3. Warm up your leads

- 4. Be effective, not busy

- Example: Try plugging your pitch into this template:
“[company]helps customers[verb] [business outcome]by[tech capability].”
For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”

### 150. Embrace Overlapping A/B Tests and Avoid the Dangers of Isolating Experiments

**Date:** 2021-10-08T06:44:42.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/embracing-overlapping-a-b-tests-and-the-danger-of-isolating-experiments


**Summary:**  
How to handle simultaneous experiments frequently comes up. Example: For example, one cannot test new ranking algorithm A (vs control) and also new ranking algorithm B (vs control) in overlapping tests. This method maintains experimental power, but can reduce accuracy (as I’ll explain later, this is not a major drawback).


**Key Points:**

- Isolated tests— Users are split into segments, and each user is enrolled in only one experiment. Your experimental power is reduced, but accuracy of results are maintained.

- Microsoft’s Online Controlled Experiments At Scale

- How Google Conducts More experiments

- Can You Run Multiple AB Tests At The Same Time?

- Large Scale Experimentation at Spotify

- Running Multiple A/B Tests at The Same Time: Do’s and Dont’s

- AtStatsig, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting many experimentalists from different backgrounds and experiences.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-causal-roundup


**Summary:**  
Covering topics from experimentation to causal inference, theStatsigteam brings to you work from leaders who are building the future of product decision-making. Example: For example, LinkedIn aims to improve its hiring products with a true north metric calledconfirmed hires(CH), which measures members who found jobs using LinkedIn products. — Lincoln
One of the challenges with improving long-term metrics such as engagement is that these metrics are hard to move and often require long drawn-out experiments.


**Key Points:**

- Mind over data at Netflix

- Mind over data📈

- Pursuit of True North 🧭

- ‘Criminally underused in tech’🚨

- Example: For example, LinkedIn aims to improve its hiring products with a true north metric calledconfirmed hires(CH), which measures members who found jobs using LinkedIn products.

- — Lincoln
One of the challenges with improving long-term metrics such as engagement is that these metrics are hard to move and often require long drawn-out experiments.

### 153. How Auth0 Nailed Demand Generation (Before Product-led Growth Became a Buzzword)

**Date:** 2021-07-30T07:12:08.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-auth0-nailed-demand-generation


**Summary:**  
Similarly, reducing friction during evaluation means that we enable these leads to get qualified as efficiently as possible. Example: Let’s use a case study to see how a well-oiled demand generation engine works. #### Automating Demand Generation in Three Steps
Product-led Growth (PLG) is magical because it does two things really well:
- It reduces the cost of acquiring leads
It reduces the cost of acquiring leads
- It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product

### 6. How we created count distinct in Statsig Cloud

**Date:** 2025-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Aamodit Acharya  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-we-created-count-distinct-in-statsig-cloud


**Summary:**  
When I joined Statsig, I spent my first week reading through customer requests. Almost immediately, a pattern jumped out to me. Unique artists in the first 7 days.


**Key Points:**

- Distinct artists listened per user

- Distinct SKUs purchased per user

- Distinct search queries issued per user

- Distinct repositories pushed per user

- Distinct merchants paid per user

- Wed: viewed {A}If you summed daily distincts you would get 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.Merging the three sketches yields {A, B, C}, which is 3.

- I kept the core model in Spark SQL and stored each day’s sketch as a base64 string in Parquet on GCS so it can safely move through BigQuery tables when needed.

- On the Spark side, I decode that field back into a native sketch and continue merges and extraction with the Spark UDFs and helpers.

### 7. Sink, swim, or scale: What startups teach us about launching AI

**Date:** 2025-08-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Alexey Komissarouk  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-startups-lessons-learned


**Summary:**  
About the guest author.Alexey Komissarouk is aGrowth Engineering Advisorwho teachesGrowth Engineering on Reforge. Previously, he was the Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Early users, however, complained they “still didn’t know what to do with this thing.”Notion pivotedfrom “AI writes for you” to “AI improves what you’ve already written,” redesigned starter prompts, and saw usage rise as the mental cost of exploration dropped.


**Key Points:**

- Pre‑negotiate burst capacity with vendors (spot GPUs, secondary clouds, reseller credits) so you scale up within minutes without surprise bills.

- Offer a “happy hour” off‑peak tier that absorbs hobby traffic without harming premium latency.

- Replace blank prompt boxes with role‑based starter chips and one‑click examples that autofill.

- Instrument “prompt redo” and “undo” events as frustration signals; run weekly funnel reviews on them.

- Offer an “explain my last prompt” toggle—turning trial‑and‑error into guided learning.

- When financially viable, start with a flat plan that eliminates mental transaction costs; layer in usage-based overages only once users reach actual ceilings.

- Expose “token burn so far” inside the interface, not tucked away in billing dashboards.

- Run price‑sensitivity experiments onengagedcohorts, not top‑of‑funnel sign‑ups; willingness to pay lags perceived mastery.

### 8. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. Example: Another great example is Notion AI, which writes and summarizes within your existing workspace. Keep response time below 200 ms and uptime above 99.9 %, and you’ve passed.


**Key Points:**

- Google's Geminioutperformed GPT-4 on 30 of 32 benchmarksand beat humans on language understanding tests. Once deployed, it suggestedadding glue to pizzato make cheese stick better.

- Perplexity faced lawsuitsforcreating fake news sectionsand falsely attributing content to real publications.

- Note: We recently launched our Evals product that solves this problem - clickhereto learn more

- Monitor success metrics.These metrics become your real quality benchmarks. The easiest way to do this is with product analytics.

- Watch user sessions.Record user interactions to understand the stories behind metrics - why users drop off, where confusion occurs, when they ignore AI suggestions.

- Ship big changes as A/B tests.Do 50/50 rollouts of what you think will be big wins to quantify the impact. This helps your team build intuition for what actually moves the needle.

- Expand.Ship features to larger and larger groups of users, monitoring success metrics and bad outcomes as you go.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

**Author:** Israel Ben Baruch  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/move-forward-the-a-b-testing-mindset-guide


**Summary:**  
Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time. It sharpens your thinking and helps you act faster if your current test fails.


**Key Points:**

- Be obsessed.You check results more than you should. You run through your funnels again and again. Your head swarms with ideas. You’re not crazy, you’re exactly where you should be.

- Organizational culture.Your mindset needs an organization that supports it - one that encourages people to take risks, experiment, and always push forward.

- Professional expertise.CRO is a craft. Find the people, the content, and the companies to learn from. Apply. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. Most importantly: keep evolving.

- Great tools.Use high-quality, reliable measurement and testing platforms. They’re the foundation of effective testing. No compromises.

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

### 10. Experimentation and AI: 4 trends we’re seeing 

**Date:** 2025-06-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. Example: Example: It has become common for chat interface-based apps (like ChatGPT, Vercel V0, Lovable) to experiment with suggested prompts to help users quickly discover and realize value, which subsequently drives engagement and retention.


**Key Points:**

- Good logging on all the product metrics you care about

- The ability to link these metrics to everything you release

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

- Trend 2: More AI code drives the need for quantitative optimization

- Trend 3: Every engineer is a growth engineer

- Trend 4: Product value comes from your unique context

- Closing thoughts: AI is part of every product

### 11. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. Example: For example, if you were a developer seeing this code, it felt like choosing between the black wire and the red wire to cut if you had a time bomb in front of you:
There was even one time when someone accidentally set production services to connect to ourlatest(dev-stage) Redis instance instead of the correct prod one. It was time to build a tool that would help us move faster and safer.


**Key Points:**

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

- First, a developer pushes changes to a repo (call it Service X).

- Automated regional rollouts, powered by StatsigRelease Pipelines

- Shadow pipeline simulations

- Cost-based VM selection automation

- Highly manual configuration

- Disconnected dependencies

### 12. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. Example: For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes.


**Key Points:**

- the number of units in the control group is relatively small, and

- the denominator is relatively noisy (but still statistically distinct from 0)

- \( Z_{\alpha/2} \) is the critical value associated with the desired confidence level

- \( \mathrm{var}(X_C) \) is the variance of the control group metric values

- \( n_C \) is the number of units in the control group

- \( \overline{X_C} \) is the mean of the control group metric values

### 13. Why data and intuition aren&#39;t enemies

**Date:** 2025-05-30T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Laurel Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-data-and-intuition-arent-enemies


**Summary:**  
I’ve always been excited by the power of data storytelling. Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example. Metrics are often consulted only when something breaks, not when there is an opportunity to improve.


**Key Points:**

- Great products come from intuition guided by data, not intuition versus data.

- The uphill battle for metrics adoption

- Reframing the relationship between data and intuition

- The adaptive nature of good metrics

- Moving forward with adaptive taste

- Finding a data-informed culture at Statsig

- Product manager playbook

- Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example.

### 14. Empowering your team is the future of product leadership

**Date:** 2025-05-28T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. Paradoxically,trying to control everything actually reduces your control over what matters most.


**Key Points:**

- Defining outcomes that matter rather than dictating every task

- Providing context about user needs and business priorities

- Creating frameworks that enable autonomous decision-making

- Trusting your engineers to determine the "how" once they understand the "why"

- The challenge of proving value

- The two paths for product leaders

- The brute force PM

- The force-multiplier leader

### 15. Simulating Bigtable in BigQuery with Type 2 SCD modeling

**Date:** 2025-05-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Example: For example, “How does user behavior on our app change before, during, and after they obtain a premium subscription?”
We also need to store these updates in aversioned mannersince customers often want to observe how user behavior changes over time or with different properties. Bigtable’s write path also comfortably sustains millions of QPS, so cross‑region replication keeps read latency below 10 ms no matter wherever the request originates, letting us replicate it in near real-time.


**Key Points:**

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- User-property updates are generated in one of two ways (in blue). Customers either set up bulk uploads in our web console, or they use our SDKS to log them at run-time.

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

- Then, we have a Dataflow that reads those updates from Bigtable CDC, and streams those to BigQuery in near real-time.

- The current state of the Bigtable:

- The state of the Bigtable at some moment in time:

- How some property has changed over time:

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

### 16. Chasing metrics, not tasks: Why outcome-obsessed PMs win

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. One of my focus areas was improving our customer acquisition funnel.


**Key Points:**

- Misaligned incentives:Measuring success by task completion rather than outcome impact reinforced a culture of checking boxes rather than driving real business results.

- Letting go of sunk costs:When the data shows an initiative isn’t working, cut it – no matter how much time you’ve invested.

- Zooming out regularly:That metric you’ve been optimizing might not be the one that matters most. Don’t miss the forest for the trees.

- My metrics-focused foundation

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- The roadmap is a false comfort

- The buy-in breakthrough

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 17. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- How do you interpret the outcome of a non-inferiority test?

- How do you properly integrate non-inferiority tests into your company's A/B testing process?

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

- Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine.

- In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.

### 18. Fail faster, learn faster: Why &#34;done&#34; beats &#34;perfect&#34; in modern product management

**Date:** 2025-05-20T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. Shipping thin slices lets you take more at-bats, improve your swing, and learn from each attempt.


**Key Points:**

- Create feedback loops to build learnings from users quickly

- Limit the potential downsides if a feature underperforms and course correct

- Build stakeholder confidence by showing visible progress

- Collect real-world feedback that no amount of planning can substitute for

- Build organizational muscle memory for rapid learning

- Create space for high-risk, high-reward ideas that might be killed in a "perfect first time" culture

- Free up resources to pursue more opportunities rather than polishing a single feature

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

### 19. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. Example: For example, let’s say you true north metric is the revenue generated in the next year. Over time, product changes can improve or degrade the quality of prediction that a particular surrogate model produces.


**Key Points:**

- Inputs should be independent of assignment. Assignment to any given experiment group should be random and not correlated to any input to the predictive model.

- Outputs should not exhibit heteroscedasticity. For each predicted value, the prediction and the expected magnitude of the error term should not be correlated.

- Best Practice for ML Engineering

**Date:** 2025-05-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.


**Key Points:**

### 22. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. But when CVR improves while retention craters, the illusion breaks.


**Key Points:**

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

- Hidden cost of partial coverage:blind spots compound. Teams over‑index on the few things they do measure, and leadership starts believing an incomplete trend line.

- Integrate feature flags and experiments so every featurecanbe a testby default.

- Align engineering KPIs with metrics impact, not feature launch.

- Sunset legacy code that cannot be instrumented; it taxes every future decision.

- Why enterprises struggle:each domain team owns a slice of data; merging them requires cross‑org agreements and latency‑tolerant pipelines.

- Metrics is the language of the company. Make them clear and transparent with a centralized catalog.

- For experiments, pick a couple of primary metrics and a few guardrail metrics. Try to standardize across similar experiments.

### 23. Release pipelines: Safer, staged rollouts across your infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-04-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/release-pipelines


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we believe you can move fastwithoutbreaking things. Your 1% of users could be distributed across hundreds of clusters, and if this change causes unexpected behavior in production, it could bring down your entire infrastructure stack, as every server experiences the increased CPU and memory usage.


**Key Points:**

- Roll out changes environment by environment (dev → staging → prod)

- Target specific infrastructure segments within environments (prod-us-west → prod-us-east → prod-eu)

- Control progression between stages with time intervals or manual approvals

- Monitor each stage before proceeding to the next

- Roll back instantly if issues arise at any stage

- Catch issues early, before they affect a large portion of your infrastructure

- Prevent cascading failuresacross your entire system, ensuring higher uptime

- Validate changes in real production environmentswith minimal risk

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Example: Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:
Figure 3:A P95 performance graph comparing our legacy Node SDK (green) and Node Core SDK (blue) runtime for a gate check.

### 25. The rise of experimentation as the industry standard

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. Example: One notable example is the16-month TV advertising experimentAmazon ran in a few markets, which showed that TV ads delivered only a modest sales bump. In the new model we grow bylearning faster—hundreds of tiny, controlled bets that compound.


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- Experimenting with the length of forms to mitigate user dropoffs

- Using 20% of an email audience to suss out the best email subject line and sending it to the remaining 80%

- Testingvirtually anythingin a focus group

- Implementing customer surveys to gauge reactions to potential upcoming initiatives

- Jeff Bezos on the importance of experimentation

### 26. Digital marketing attribution models: A tech survey

**Date:** 2025-04-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. Example: Early versions were still rule-based (for example, splitting credit evenly or favoring the first and last touches). MMM emerged in the 1950s (though it rose to popularity in the 1980s) as a top-down approach that uses aggregate data and statistical regression to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel to sales [1].


**Key Points:**

- Shapley Value Attribution

- Algorithmic/Statistical Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ML)

- Incrementality Testing and Lift Models

- Causal Inference-Based Multi-Channel Attribution

- Customer Journey-based Deep Learning Models

- Captures sequential nature of journeys.

- Explains results via the “If we remove channel X, how many conversions are lost?” logic, which is intuitive.

- More nuanced than any single-position rule; channels that primarily appear in converting paths get more credit.

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Example: For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:
On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of. We also have tools likeCUPEDthat will control for values that we can see before the experiment, avoiding the worst of the bias and making your experiments run faster.


**Key Points:**

- You have to choose experiments that can be applied across pages, and that you'd expect to have a similar impact on each of the pages you'd apply it to.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

- Image optimizations,such as enabling lazy loading across all pages.

- Multimedia enhancements,like adding audio versions of blog posts to see if this boosts engagement or traffic.

- Challenges of SEO A/B testing

- Designing your experiment

- Sidecar no-code A/B testing

### 29. Introducing CURE: Smarter regression, faster experiments

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/announcing-cure


**Summary:**  
Statsig is excited to announce that we’re moving out of beta testing and into full production launch for CURE - an extension of CUPED - which allows users to add arbitrary covariate data to regression adjustment in their experiments, reducing variance even further than existing CUPED implementations. Example: For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results. For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED: Controlled [Experiment] Using Pre-Experiment Data

- CURE: [Variance] Control Using Regression Estimates

- If you have a predictive model of future behaviors, you can easilyuse that as a covariate in CURE(like Doordash’s CUPAC)

- If you want to provide additional signal to the standard CUPAC approach, you canpick and choose different user attributes or behaviorsto add to the regression

- CURE brings powerful, flexible regression adjustment to every Statsig experiment.

**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/buying-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
“Building your own experimentation platform made a lot of sense… five years ago,” says our customer Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager - Core ML at Whatnot, who previously worked on DoorDash’s in-house platform. Example: For example, over the past year we’ve shipped several advanced capabilities that you won’t find in a typical experimentation platform:
- Stats methodologies such as stratified sampling, differential impact detection, interaction detection, Benjamini Hochberg procedure etc. Over the past few years, several companies have moved away from in-house experimentation tooling and turned to Statsig to scale their experimentation cultures.Notionincreased their experimentation velocity by 30x within a year.Limewent from limited testing to experimenting on every change before rolling it out.


**Key Points:**

### 36. KPI traps: How &#34;successful&#34; experiments can still be failures

**Date:** 2025-03-05T00:02-08:00  
**Author:** Lin Jia  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kpi-traps-successful-experiments-can-fail


**Summary:**  
You set up the experiment cautiously, collected data diligently, and celebrated when it achieved statistical significance for your KPI. Example: For example, a company notices that customer service calls are taking too long. When they run a two-week experiment to measure the impact, they find that DAU increases as more users return to the app.


**Key Points:**

- Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever.

- Success on paper, but failure in practice

- False positive risk

- False positive risk given the success rate, p-value threshold of 0.025 (successes only), and 80% power

### 37. Beyond prompts: A data-driven approach to LLM optimization

**Date:** 2025-03-04T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Anna Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/llm-optimization-online-experimentation


**Summary:**  
This article presents a systematic framework for online A/B testing of LLM applications, focusing onprompt engineering, model selection, and temperature tuning. Example: ## Experiment design and statistical rigor
### Hypothesis and goal
Define a measurable hypothesis: e.g., “Adding an example to the prompt will increase correct answer rates by 5%.” This clarity guides your metrics and success criteria. By isolating and experimenting with specific factors, teams can generate tangible improvements in performance, user engagement, and cost-efficiency.


**Key Points:**

- Improve performance: Validate hypothesis-driven changes (like new prompts) directly with real users.

- Reduce costs: Pinpoint “good enough” model variants or narrower context windows that maintain quality while lowering expenses.

- Boost engagement: Track user behaviors such as conversation length, retention, or click-through rates to ensure AI experiences resonate with users.

- Randomized user allocation: Users are split—often 50/50—so each group experiences only one variant. Randomization ensures a fair comparison.

- Single variable isolation: If testing a new prompt, keep the model and temperature consistent across both variants to attribute outcome differences to prompt changes.

- A different base model (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5).

- A refined prompt with new instructions or examples.

- Altered parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p).

**Summary:**  
Your team designed the feature well, you set ambitious business targets, you built the feature well, and designed a solid A/B test to measure the results. Example: For example, if you're testing a new user interface, your primary metric might be the click-through rate on a feature button. While you aim to improve specific aspects of your product through A/B testing, you shouldn’t compromise on the overall system and business health.


**Key Points:**

- Ensuring that gains in one area do not cause losses in another

- Providing a holistic view of the impact of your tests

- Interactions with other features

### 45. The ultimate guide to building an internal feature flagging system

**Date:** 2025-01-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
“Why do people pay for this?”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions. Example: You’re also likely to find some synergies in the code you write across these two services - for example, the service that provides evaluated flag values to clients can borrow logic from the code that evaluates rulesets on your servers, provided they’re written in the same language. - Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?


**Key Points:**

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

- Handle targeting on any user trait, like app version, country, IP address, etc.?

- Have extremely high uptime?

- test a feature in production (by “gating” it to only employees/ beta testers)

- rollout a feature to only certain geographies (by “gating” on user countries)

- run an A/B test (by gating a feature to a random 50% of userIDs)

- Or Run acanary release(release a feature to a random 10% of userIDs, to check that it doesn’t break anything)

### 46. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. Example: For example, if most control exposures come from the US while the test group is evenly split between EU and US, the issue might be linked to the SDK in the EU release. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users.


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Why it’s important

- Our new debugging capabilities

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, if most control exposures come from the US while the test group is evenly split between EU and US, the issue might be linked to the SDK in the EU release.

Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands thrive by forging direct relationships with customers—yet this also makes them vulnerable to every friction point along the user journey. Example: For example, small tweaks to the timing or format of promotional emails can reduce churn and encourage repeat purchases within 28 days. keyword-based) or surface trending bundles (“Complete the look”) to see which approach not only increases product visibility but also boosts average order value.


**Key Points:**

- For direct-to-consumer brands, data-driven testing is the real game-changer.

- Why D2C brands face unique challenges

- Friction during first-time conversions

- Overlooked opportunities in product discovery

- How experimentation offers solutions

### 51. When allocation point and exposure point differ

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/when-allocation-point-and-exposure-point-differ


**Summary:**  
Since this feature isn’t visible when the page loads, users in the test group might leave before scrolling down to see it. Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not. If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.


**Key Points:**

- Why does it happen?

- Why does it matter?

- What should you do?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not.

- If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.

### 53. You don&#39;t need large sample sizes to run A/B tests

**Date:** 2024-12-12T03:15+00:00  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/you-dont-need-large-sample-sizes-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Yet many small and medium-sized companies aren’t running A/B Tests. Example: Google routinely runs large search tests on a massive scale, for example 100,000,000 users where a+0.1% effect on topline metrics is a big win. A/B testing is a pillar of data-driven product development irrespective of the product’s size
### Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing
Startup companies have a major advantage in experimentation:huge potential and upside.Startups don’t play the micro-optimization game; they don’t care about a +0.2% increase in click-through rates.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED(Controlled Experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) leverages historical metrics to reduce noise and refine your estimates.

- Stratified Samplingensures balanced and reliable comparisons across small, skewed user segments.

- Differential Impactcan reveal directional and qualitative findings, providing a little more color to the results of your experiment.

- Small companies’ secret advantage in experimentation

- Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing

- Bayesian A/B test calculator

- Google vs a startup: Who has more statistical power?

- Big effects are seldom obvious

### 54. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Azure AI Integration

**Date:** 2024-11-19T05:30-08:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/azure-ai-annoucement


**Summary:**  
In the past year, AI has gone from interesting to impactful. While people had built AI applications prior to 2024, there were few that had achieved massive scale. Example: Here’s an example of a dynamic config:
Once you’ve created this client, calling a model in code is easy. Once this is implemented, all you need to do to adjust the configuration of your model is to change the value of your dynamic config in Statsig.Once the change to the config is made, it will be live in any target applications in ~10 seconds!


**Key Points:**

- Configure your Azure AI modelsfrom a single pane of glass

- Implement Azure AI models in codeusing a simple, lightweight framework

- Automatically collect a variety of metricson model & application performance

- Run powerful A/B tests and experimentsto optimize your AI application

- Compute the results of all tests automatically- with no additional work required

- They provide a layer of abstraction from direct Azure AI API calls, letting you store API parameters in a config and change them dynamically (rather than making code changes)

- They give you a simplified framework for implementing Azure AI models in code

- Targeting releases to internal users to test changes in your production environment

### 55. It’s normal not to be normal(ly distributed): what to do when data is not normally distributed

**Date:** 2024-10-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-to-do-when-data-is-not-normally-distributed


**Summary:**  
Gosset wanted to estimate the quality of the company’s beer, but was concerned that existing statistical methods would be unreliable due to a small sample size. Example: A familiar example is election polling: statisticians want to predict the outcome for all voters but must rely on a sample of survey responses. Key statistical principles, such as the Central Limit Theorem and Slutsky’s Theorem, show that as the sample size increases, the t statistic converges toward a normal distribution.


**Key Points:**

- Normal distribution: the KPI follows a normal distribution.

- Non-normal distribution: the KPI has a non-normal distribution.

- William Sealy Gosset, a former Head Brewer at Guinness Brewery, had a problem.

- Why do we need the normality assumption?

- The normality assumption with large sample sizes

- So, t-test it is?

- Example: A familiar example is election polling: statisticians want to predict the outcome for all voters but must rely on a sample of survey responses.

- Key statistical principles, such as the Central Limit Theorem and Slutsky’s Theorem, show that as the sample size increases, the t statistic converges toward a normal distribution.

### 59. Introducing experimental meta-analysis and the knowledge base

**Date:** 2024-10-09T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimental-meta-analysis-and-knowledge-base


**Summary:**  
Over the past three years, we’ve seen several companies significantly scale their experimentation culture, often increasing their experimentation velocity by 10-30x within a year. Example: For example, if you’ve spent a quarter testing ways to optimize product recommendations in your e-commerce app, an individual experiment might guide a ship decision. Whatnot hit a run rate of 400 experiments last year,Notion scaled from single-digit to hundreds per quarter,Rec Room went from nearly zero to 150 experimentsin their first year with Statsig, andLime started testing every change they roll out.


**Key Points:**

- What experiments are running now?

- When are they expected to end?

- What % of experiments ship Control vs Test?

- What is the typical duration?

- Do experiments run for their planned duration or much longer or shorter?

- Do experiments impact key business metrics or only shallow or team-level metrics?

- How much do they impact key business metrics?

### 64. Why you should &#34;accept&#34; the null hypothesis when hypothesis testing

**Date:** 2024-09-25T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-accept-null


**Summary:**  
You can only fail to reject it!” is widely circulated but fundamentally flawed.


**Key Points:**

- Many people mistakenly interpret "accepting" the null as "proving" it, which is incorrect.

- Null and alternative hypotheses treated symmetrically:Both (H_0) and (H_1) are explicitly defined, and tests are designed to decide between them based on the data.

- Fisher:The alternative hypothesis is often implicit or not formally specified. The focus is on assessing evidence against (H_0).

- Neyman-Pearson:The alternative hypothesis ((H_1)) is explicitly defined, and tests are constructed to distinguish between (H_0) and (H_1).

- Fisher:Emphasizes measuring evidence against (H_0) without necessarily making a final decision.

- Neyman-Pearson:Emphasizes making a decision between (H_0) and (H_1), incorporating the long-run frequencies of errors.

- Fisher's Null Hypothesis:A unique, specific hypothesis tested to see if there is significant evidence against it, using p-values as a measure of evidence.

### 65. Optimizing config propagation time with target apps

**Date:** 2024-09-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sam Miller  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-config-propagation-time-with-target-apps


**Summary:**  
Propagation latency is defined as the time it takes for a change made in the Console to be reflected by the config checks you issue on your frontend or backend systems with our SDKs. Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps.


**Key Points:**

- Performance: By filtering out irrelevant configurations, the payload sent to each SDK instance is smaller, leading to faster initialization times and lower memory usage

- At Statsig, we’re constantly finding ways to drive down what we call config propagation latency.

- What are target apps?

- Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps.

### 67. CUPED Explained

**Date:** 2024-09-15T00:00-05:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped


**Summary:**  
MeaningControlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data, CUPED is frequently cited as—and used as—one of the most powerful algorithmic tools for increasing the speed and accuracy of experimentation programs. Example: In the example below, it’s pretty obvious that the difference in the groupsbeforethe test would make the results extremely skewed:
You might note that you can see that the weighted runners’ times went up, and the unweighted runners’ times went down. In this article, we’ll:
- Cover the background of CUPED
Cover the background of CUPED
- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
## What CUPED solves:
As an experiment matures and hits its target date for readout, it’s not uncommon to see a result that seems to beonly barelyoutside the range where it would be treated as statistical


**Key Points:**

- Cover the background of CUPED

- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED

- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments

- The effect size in our T-test (the delta between test and control) is exactly the same as the “test” variable’s coefficient in the OLS regression.

- The standard error for the coefficient is the same as the standard error for our T-test.

- The p-value for the “test” variable coefficient is the same as for our t-test!

- Our p-value goes from 0.116 to 0.000 because of the decreased Standard Error. The result, which was previously not statistically significant, is now clearly significant.

- Multiply the pre-experiment population mean byθand add it to each user’s result

**Date:** 2024-09-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Morgan Scalzo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-experimentation-infrastructure-and-culture-ronny-kohavi


**Summary:**  
We recently hosted a virtual meetup featuring Allon Korem, CEO ofBell, and Ronny Kohavi, awidely respected thought leaderand expert in experimentation. Example: For example, a p-value of 0.01 does not mean there is a 99% chance of success. - Experimentation culture: Establishing an organizational culture that embraces experimentation is vital for continuous growth and improvement.


**Key Points:**

- Case study: Only 12% of 1,000 experiments succeeded, illustrating the harsh reality that many organizations must accept—a high failure rate is normal.

- Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches: They covered the differences between these two statistical approaches and their applications in experimentation.

- A/A tests as best practice: RunningA/A testsis strongly recommended to validate experimentation setups and ensure the reliability of testing infrastructure.

- Asymmetric allocation: This approach can provide advantages to the larger group in an experiment, optimizing for specific outcomes.

- You can always learn something from people with lots of experience.

- Key insights from Ronny Kohavi

- Should every organization aim for "fly" in every category?

- Discussion on failures

- Posthog's experimentation offering is consistently the most expensive option and has the most restrictive free tier
Posthog's experimentation offering is consistently the most expensive option and has the most restrictive free tier
## Other things to consider
When evaluating experimentation


**Key Points:**

- Monthly Active Users (MAU) act as a standardized benchmark across platforms. It is assumed that 100% of MAU are tracked (monthly tracked users (MTU))

- Each monthly user creates 20 unique sessions per month

- One request (or exposure event) is used per session

- 5 analytics events are used per session

- 20 gates are instrumented per session (this would mean that 20 gates exist within the product)

- 50% of gates are checked each session (meaning half of the 20 gates are used by the average user)

- Statsig and VWO offer the cheapest experimentation platform at low volumes (< 100K MAU)

- Statsig offers enterprise pricing starting at around 200K MAU, making it cheapest and most scalable option at higher volumes

### 71. Why Kayak lets you pick your plane

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kayak-aircraft-filter-feature


**Summary:**  
And neither were the passengers of Alaska Airlines flight 1282, whose emergency exit door fell out in January, forcing the pilot of the Boeing 737 Max to conduct an emergency landing. Example: Steve Hafner, the CEO of Kayak, goes on to say, “While the overall fraction of users filtering the 737 remains small, usage increased following the Alaska Airlines incident in January(15x compared to month prior from a low baseline), and it has since decreased until this past week (to 10x compared to Dec 2023).”
## What Kayak did right

### 72. What is A/B testing and why is it important?

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-is-a-b-testing-and-why-is-it-important


**Summary:**  
Underlying AB testing is the concept of “randomized controlled trials (RCTs).” It is the gold standard in finding causality. Example: Let’s use one quick example, which also illustrates what “random assignment” is and its importance. ## Understanding treatment effect with an example
Suppose I claim that I have a magic pill that costs $100 and can increase the height of high school students by 1 inch over a year.


**Key Points:**

- With randomized assignments, the difference between the treatment group and the control group iscaused by the treatment.

- Test group:1000 students who voluntarily took the pill a year ago. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 62 inches this year.

- Control group:1000 students from the same schools with the same age. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 61 inches this year.

- Claim:We shipped a feature and metrics increased 10%

- Reality:The metrics will increase 10% without the feature, such as shipping a Black Friday banner before Black Friday.

- Claim:We shipped a feature, and users who use the feature saw 10% increase in their metrics

- Reality:The users who self-select into using the feature would see a 10% increase without the feature, such as giving a button to power users(ref: why most aha moments are wrong?)

- Humans are bad at attributions and are subject to lots of biases

### 75. Why the uplift in A/B tests often differs from real-world results

**Date:** 2024-08-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-the-uplift-in-a-b-tests-often-differs-from-real-world


**Summary:**  
This disconnect can be puzzling and disappointing, especially when decisions and expectations are built around these tests. Example: A common example I’ve encountered with clients involves tests that yield inconclusive (non-significant) results. While reducing the significance level can decrease the number of false positives, it would also require longer test durations, which may not always be feasible.


**Key Points:**

- Human bias in analysis and interpretation

- False positives

- Sequential testing and overstated effect sizes

- Novelty effect and user behavior

- External validity and real-world factors

- Limited exposure in testing

- Strategies for mitigating discrepancies

### 81. Hypothesis Testing explained in 4 parts

**Date:** 2024-07-22T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-explained


**Summary:**  
As data scientists, Hypothesis Testing is expected to be well understood, but often not in reality. It is mainly because our textbooks blend two schools of thought – p-value and significance testing vs. Example: For example, some questions are not obvious unless you have thought through them before:
- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis? Third, to illustrate the two concepts concisely, let’s run a visualization by just changing the sample size from 30 to 100 and see how power increases from 86.3% to almost 100%.


**Key Points:**

- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis?

- Can we accept the null hypothesis? Why?

- How does MDE change with alpha holding beta constant?

- Why do we use standard error in Hypothesis Testing but not the standard deviation?

- Why can’t we be specific about the alternative hypothesis so we can properly model it?

- Why is the fundamental tradeoff of the Hypothesis Testing about mistake vs. discovery, not about alpha vs. beta?

- We emphasize a clear distinction between the standard deviation and the standard error, and why the latter is used in Hypothesis Testing

- We explain fully when can you “accept” a hypothesis, when shall you say “failing to reject” instead of “accept”, and why

**Summary:**  
Online experimentation is becoming more commonplace across all types of businesses today. #### Rewards:
- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.


**Key Points:**

- Noisy data:Early data can be noisy and may not represent the true effect of the experiment, leading to incorrect conclusions (higher likelihood of false positives/false negatives).

- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.

- Resource allocation:Identifying a strong positive or negative trend can help decide whether to continue investing resources in the experiment.

- Select a population: Choose the appropriate population for your experiment. This could be based on a past experiment, a qualifying event, or the entire user base.

- Choose metrics: Input the metrics you plan to use as your evaluation criteria. You can add multiple metrics to analyze sensitivity in your target population.

- Run the power analysis: Provide the above inputs to the tool. Statsig will simulate an experiment, calculating population sizes and variance based on historical behavior.

- Review the readout: Examine the week-by-week simulation results. This will show estimates of the number of users eligible for the experiment each day, derived from historical data.

- It can shrink confidence intervals and p-values, which means that statistically significant results can be achieved with a smaller sample size.

### 89. Statsig&#39;s Autotune adds contextual bandits for personalization

**Date:** 2024-06-26T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-autotune-contextual-bandits-personalization


**Summary:**  
These contextual bandits are a lightweight form of reinforcement learning that gives teams an easy way to personalize user experiences. Example: For example, a contextual bandit is a great choice to personalize if a user should see “Sports”, “Science”, or “Celebrities” as their top video unit; but it won’t be a good fit for determining which video (with new candidates every day, and with potentially tens of thousands of options) to show them. Running a few tests with Autotune AI can quickly give signal on how much there is to gain from personalizing product surfaces - potentially justifying investing in a dedicated team
## Start measuring your personalization
Hundreds of customers already use Statsig to measure improvements to theirpersonalization program.


**Key Points:**

- Don’t yet have the bandwidth to solve these problems, but want a placeholder for personalization as their teams get more mission-critical parts of their product built

- We’re excited to announce that Statsig’s multi-armed bandit platform (Autotune)now includes contextual bandits.

- When to use contextual bandits

- Hit the perfect note with Autotuned experiments

- Bring your own training data

- An easy integration

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/warehouse-native-year-in-review


**Summary:**  
Since then, Warehouse Native has grown into a core product for us; we treat it with the same priority as Statsig Cloud, and have developed the two products to share core infrastructure, methodology, and design philosophies. Example: - More tools in the warehouse; for example, we have a beta version ofMetrics Explorerfor warehouse native customers and are excited to continue developing this - sharing a metric definition language between quick metric explorations and advanced statistical calculations helps bridge the gap between exploratory work and rigorous measurement. One of the competitive advantages we think Statsig has is “clock speed” - we just build faster than other teams building the same thing.


**Key Points:**

- Willingness - and internal/external alignment - to ship things that were functional-but-ugly

- Letting the development team play to their strengths

- Treating early customers like team members

- An Engineering “Code Machine” - someone who could crank out quality code twice as fast as other engineers

- A PM “Tech Lead” - someone who leads efforts across the company

- A DS “Product Hybrid” - someone who bridges product and engineering to solve complex business problems

- A year ago, Statsig announced Warehouse Native, bringing our experimentation platform into customers’ Data Warehouses.

### 96. How to debug your experiments and feature rollouts

**Date:** 2024-05-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-debug-your-experiments-and-feature-rollouts


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a product manager, or a software engineer, you know that even the most meticulously planned test rollout can encounter unexpected hiccups. Example: Statsig also allows you to override specific users, for example, if you wanted to test your feature with employees first in production. Statsig also offersstratified sampling; When experimenting on a user base where a tail-end of power users drive a large portion of an overall metric value, stratified sampling meaningfully reduces false positive rates and makes your results more consistent and trustworthy.


**Key Points:**

- Inadequate sampling: A sample that's too small or not representative of an evenly weighted distribution can lead to inconclusive or misleading results.

- Lack of confidence in metrics: Without trustworthy success metrics, it's harder to determine how to make a decision.

- User exposure issues: If users aren't exposed to the experiment as intended, your data won't reflect their true behavior.

- Biased experiments: Running multiple experiments that affect the same variables can contaminate your results.

- Technical errors: Bugs in the code can introduce unexpected variables that impact the experiment's outcome.

- Success criteria: Before launching an experiment, it's crucial to define how you’re measuring success. Make these metrics readily available for analysis.

- Running experiments mutually exclusively: To prevent experiments from influencing each other, consider using feature flagging frameworks.

- When it comes to digital experimentation and feature rollouts, the devil is often in the details.

### 97. How to track your features&#39; retention

**Date:** 2024-05-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-track-your-features-retention


**Summary:**  
The most common use of retention metrics that you’re familiar with, when A and B are the same action over different time periods T0 and T1, is just a special case of this more generalized definition. Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage. For example, day-of-week seasonality can be aggregated away by setting T0 and T1 to be 7 days in duration and measuring retention on a weekly cadence.


**Key Points:**

- Choosing appropriate A, B, T0, and T1

- The specificity vs sample size trade-off (choosing A)

- When repeated feature usage is more/less meaningful (choosing B)

- Evaluating useful time ranges (choosing T0, T1, and how many retention data points to generate)

- Using Metrics Explorer on Statsig to track feature retention

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage.

**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-experiments-technical-guide


**Summary:**  
Experimentation in such environments is not just beneficial; it's essential. Example: For example, during an early proof of concept, a customer tested search functionality in their marketplace. This allows you to observe if an increase in one area is causing a decrease in another, indicating cannibalization, or if improvements in one part of the marketplace are positively affecting other areas, indicating spillover benefits.Statsig's experimentation platform allows you tochoose any unit of randomizationto analyze different user groups, pages, sessions, and other dimensions, which can help in understanding the nuanced effects of experiments across the marketplace.


**Key Points:**

### 110. Experimentation metrics in software development (with examples!)

**Date:** 2024-04-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-metrics-software-development-examples


**Summary:**  
This is the same vibe, just with different tools. At the heart of this process are the metrics themselves, which serve as the compass guiding developers toward improved user experiences, performance, and business outcomes.


**Key Points:**

- Validate hypotheses:By measuring the effect of changes, metrics can confirm or refute the assumptions behind a new feature or improvement.

- Make data-driven decisions:Instead of relying on gut feelings or opinions, metrics provide objective data that can inform the next steps.

- Understand user behavior:Metrics can reveal how users interact with your product, which features they value, and where they encounter friction.

- Optimize product performance:From load times to resource usage, metrics can highlight areas for technical refinement.

- User retention rate:This metric tracks the percentage of users who return to the product over a specific period after their initial visit or sign-up.

- Churn rate:The churn rate calculates the percentage of users who stop using the product within a given timeframe, indicating customer satisfaction and product stickiness.

- Session duration:The average length of a user's session provides insights into user engagement and the product's ability to hold users' attention.

- Conversion rate:This metric measures the percentage of users who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter.

### 112. The role of confidence levels in statistical analysis

**Date:** 2024-04-04T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/confidence-levels-in-statistical-analysis


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a business analyst, or just someone interested in understanding the nuances of statistical inference, grasping the concept of confidence levels is crucial. Example: For example, a 95% confidence level suggests that if we were to conduct the same study 100 times, we would expect the true parameter to fall within our calculated confidence interval in 95 out of those 100 times.


**Key Points:**

- The sample statistic (e.g., the sample mean)

- The standard error of the statistic

- The desired confidence level

- CI:This stands for "Confidence Interval." It represents the range within which we expect the population mean to lie, given our sample mean and level of confidence.

- Sample Mean: This is the average value of your sample data. It is denoted by the symbol `x̄` (x-bar).

- ±:This symbol indicates that the confidence interval has two bounds: an upper bound and a lower bound.

- What is a confidence level?

- Get more confidence!

### 114. Intro to triangle charts (and their use cases)

**Date:** 2024-03-31T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/intro-triangle-charts-retention


**Summary:**  
Triangle charts, also known as retention tables, are a powerful tool for understanding user behavior over time. This is crucial for identifying whether new features, updates, or changes in strategy are improving user engagement.


**Key Points:**

- Vertical analysis:Looking down a column allows you to compare the retention rates of different cohorts at the same lifecycle stage.

- Horizontal analysis:Reading across a row shows how a single cohort's retention evolves over time.

- Identifying patterns:They help in spotting patterns such as specific times when users tend to drop off or when they are most engaged.

- Product development:Understanding retention can guide product development by highlighting areas that need improvement to keep users coming back.

- When exploring the world of data visualization, you'll encounter various chart types, each with unique strengths.

### 115. Novelty effects: Everything you need to know

**Date:** 2024-03-20T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/novelty-effects


**Summary:**  
Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness. Example: For example, feature level funnel, and feature level retention, can tell us whether users finished using the feature as we intended and whether they come back to the feature. Imagine this – the restaurant you pass by every day had a 100% improvement on their menu, their chef and their services.


**Key Points:**

- Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness.

- Not all products have novelty effects. They exist mostly in high-frequency products.

- Ignoring the temporary nature of novelty effects may lead to incorrect product decisions, and worse, bad culture.

- The most effective way to find novelty effects and control them is to examinethe time series of treatment effects.

- The root cause solution is to use a set of metrics that correctly represent user intents.

- When understood and used correctly, novelty effects can help you.

- Novelty effects are part of the treatment effects, so there is no statistical method to detect them generically

- Novelty effects are dangerous and will spread if you don’t combat them

### 116. How to monitor the long term effects of your experiment

**Date:** 2024-03-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-monitor-the-long-term-effects-of-your-experiment


**Summary:**  
Now, imagine discovering six months later that it actually reduced long-term retention. Example: Let's get practical with an example from Statsig.


**Key Points:**

- User behavior is unpredictable: Users might initially react positively to a new feature but lose interest over time.

- External factors: Events outside your control, such as a global pandemic, can drastically alter user engagement and skew your experiment results.

- You then model these early signals against historical data of known long-term outcomes. This helps predict the eventual impact on retention.

- It's important to choose surrogate indexes wisely. They must have a proven correlation with the long-term outcome you care about.

- Engaged user biasmeans you're mostly hearing from your power users. They're not your average customer, so their feedback might lead you down a narrow path.

- Selective sampling issuesoccur when you only look at a subset of users. This might make you miss out on broader trends.

- Diversify your data sources: Don't rely solely on one type of user feedback. Look at a mix of both highly engaged users and those less active.

- Use stratified sampling: This means you'll divide your user base into smaller groups or strata based on characteristics like usage frequency. Then, sample evenly from these groups.

### 117. Demystifying identity resolution

**Date:** 2024-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/demystifying-identity-resolution


**Summary:**  
The notion of “identity resolution” in the SaaS world continues to be an elusive gold standard that businesses want to solve in order to understand the full scope of customer behaviors across all touch-points. Example: ## Example ID resolution scenarios
Scenario 1:An unknown user visits the website and gets assigned to the “Test” group fornav_v2experiment using via a deviceID.


**Key Points:**

- No technology providers will solve every use-case and scenario perfectly, though many will make bold claims. There is a ton of nuance here and no one-size-fits-all solution.

- It is strictly impossible to reliably identify a single human interacting anonymously on two different devices that never identify themselves.

- Unknown user identity becomes the crux of the challenge. When switching devices, browsers, environments (server vs. client), or clearing device storage, this ID will not persist.

- The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds.

- A few disclaimers, debunkings, and considerations as we dive in:

- Identity boundary basics

- What does this have to do with experimentation?

### 126. Onboarding for growth with A/B tests

**Date:** 2023-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/onboarding-for-growth-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
For B2B SaaS applications, a user’s very first login or download experience has a significant influence on their engagement metrics. Example: Example experiment hypothesis: Tooltip pop-ups at every screen might empower users to progress through the onboarding workflow, thereby increasing the percentage of onboarding completions and subsequently active usage. The quicker you guide them to this revelation (decrease time-to-value), the more likely they are to become sticky, which significantly impacts core metrics such as daily active users (DAU) and ultimately retention and net recurring revenue (NRR).


**Key Points:**

- Incorporating contextual tooltips or pop-ups that empower users to navigate through the workflow (sometimes even including a brief autoplay tutorial)

- Highlighting specific high-value feature(s) that give early wins for users

- Featuring a “one-click quick start” or similar capability that automatically configures basic parameters for immediate use of features

- Offering different plans such as a free trial with limited features vs a premium trial with full access

- Personalizing messaging based on the user's persona such as their industry or role

- Offering discounts in the eleventh hour is not the growth strategy of champions.

- Successful onboarding-for-growth implementations

- Testing and identifying winning features

**Date:** 2023-08-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cloud-hosted-saas-vs-open-source-experimentation-platforms


**Summary:**  
Do you:
- Build your own in-house platform
Build your own in-house platform
- Fork an open-source platform and self-host it
Fork an open-source platform and self-host it
- Go buy a cloud solution
Go buy a cloud solution
This is a conversation I have often, and as a result, I have unique insight into what makes a good decision. Compare the functional needs, reliability, scalability, and costs of an in-house solution versus an external service to evaluate which may offer faster innovation.


**Key Points:**

- Build your own in-house platform

- Fork an open-source platform and self-host it

- You’re faced with a dilemma:

- In-house build vs. off-the-shelf solution

- There’s no such thing as free

- Join the Slack community

- The opportunity cost of open source

- Follow Statsig on Linkedin

### 128. Lessons from Notion: How to build a great AI product, if you&#39;re not an AI company

**Date:** 2023-06-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/notion-how-to-build-an-ai-product


**Summary:**  
Imagine that you’re the CEO of a successful documents company. You know it’s time to build an AI product. Example: With the rate at which the AI space is changing, there will be constant opportunities to improve the AI product by:
- Swapping out models (i.e., replacing GPT-3.5-turbo with GPT-4)
Swapping out models (i.e., replacing GPT-3.5-turbo with GPT-4)
- Creating a new, purpose-built model (i.e., taking an open-source model and training it for your application)
Creating a new, purpose-built model (i.e., taking an open-source model and training it for your application)
- Fine-tuning an off-the-shelf model for your application

### 129. Online experimentation: The new paradigm for building AI applications

**Date:** 2023-04-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Palak Goel and Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-products-require-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:
First, product managers would come up with a new idea for a product and lay out a release timeline. Example: But the risks are palpable—for every AI success story, there’s an example of a biased model sharing misinformation, or a feature being pulled due to safety concerns. #### In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today.


**Key Points:**

- How can you launch and iterate on features quickly without compromising your existing user experience?

- How can you move fast while ensuring your apps are safe and reliable?

- How can you ensure that the features you launch lead to substantive, differentiated improvements in user outcomes?

- How can you identify the optimal prompts and models for your specific use case?

- Build compelling AI features that engage users

- Flight dozens of models, prompts and parameters in the ‘back end’ of these features

- Collect data on all inputs and outputs

- Use this data to select the best-performing variant and fine-tune new models

**Author:** Geunbae &#34;GB&#34; Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-importance-of-design-in-b2b-saas


**Summary:**  
The expectations of a delightful user experience—previously reserved for the realm of B2C products—have bled into B2B space as well, with enterprise customers expecting to be delighted by the look and feel of the products that they’re using. Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.


**Key Points:**

- A well-designed product is a strong foundation

- A well-designed product is your value prop, an edge vs. competitors

- A well-designed product helps your team to move faster

- A well-designed product is key in establishing your brand

- Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.

### 133. Statsig—Now With Your Warehouse

**Date:** 2022-09-15T00:00-04:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-with-your-warehouse


**Summary:**  
This makes it so that you can use your existing events and metrics with Statsig’s experimentation engine. Based on the previous pain points, we built the new approach with the following goals in mind:
- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started
Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started
- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
- Keep things consistent: We’ll treat your imported data just the same as SDK data, materializing into experiment results, creating tracking datasets, and eventually allowing you to explore it in tools like Events Explorer.


**Key Points:**

- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started

- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig

- In your Statsig metrics page, you’ll be able to find the new “Ingestions” tab

- Here, you can give us connection information for one of the supported data warehouses

- You’ll give us a SQL snippet that provides a view for your base metric or event data. This can be as simple as aSELECT *from your existing table!

- In the console, you’ll be able to map your existing fields into Statsig fields

- Once that’s done you can preview the data we’ll pull, set an ingestion schedule, and optionally load some recent historical data to get started.

- Running a scheduled pull and processing your data on your chosen schedule

### 135. CUPED on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-07-07T21:55:42.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics. Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).


**Key Points:**

- The more stable a metric tends to be for the same user over time, the more CUPED can reduce variance and pre-experiment bias

- CUPED utilizespre-exposuredata for users, so experiments on new users or newly logged metrics won’t be able to leverage this technique

- Getting in the habit of setting up key metrics and starting to track metrics before an experiment starts will help you to get the most out of CUPED on Statsig

- Run experiments with more speed and accuracy

- How this will help you

- Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).

- Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics.

**Summary:**  
Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear.”
… wroteC.S. Example: Three working principles that I rely on heavily:
- Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
- Make it trivial to test a change with a small section of users, and progressively expand the blast radius; for example, start by dog-fooding features with internal employees, then open up to a small group customers, say, who asked for the feature, then expand more broadly

### 138. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
They’re trying several ideas at any given time. If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.


**Key Points:**

- Have a clear set of questions the holdout is designed to answer. This will guide your design, holdout duration, value you get and will dictate what costs make sense to incur.

- Understand the costs associated with holdouts. Make sure teams that will pay those costs understand holdout goals and buy in.

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Feature Level Holdouts

- Measuring Cumulative Impact

- If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts!) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way. Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.


**Key Points:**

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

- The target population is split randomly for a test, where some get the solution (Test) and some don’t (Control)

- Unrealized Value: Testing to Understand

- Don’t Waste Your Tests: Take Time to Think About The Results

- Parting Thoughts

- Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.

### 141. Modernizing the Customer Data Stack

**Date:** 2022-04-18T21:30:15.000Z  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/modernizing-the-customer-data-stack


**Summary:**  
There are two key factors influencing this rapid modernization:
- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.


**Key Points:**

- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.

- Businesses want to leverage rapidly evolving and automated data intelligence inside their customer-facing applications.

- Websites, mobile applications and server side applications.

- If a business is generating calculated metrics, model outputs or cohorts in a warehouse, that ultimately becomes a data producer as well.

- Help desks, payment systems, marketing tools, A/B testing tools, ad platforms, CRMs, etc.

- Too many custom pipelines, SDKs and transformations decrease the fidelity and manageability of data over time.

- It’s impossible to enforce schema standardization across channels without introducing latency (Everyone loves a bolt onMDM… right?).

- It’s impossible to resolve user identities across channels without complex user identity services, which introduce latency.

### 144. Introducing Autotune: Statsig’s Multiarmed Bandit

**Date:** 2022-02-03T20:33:11.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-autotune


**Summary:**  
MAB is a well-known probability problem that involves balancing exploration vs exploitation (Ref. Example: ### Case Study: A Real Autotune Test on statsig.com
Statsig’s website (www.statsig.com) showcases Statsig’s products and offerings. We provide a few parameters to play with, but for most use-cases you can use the defaults like we did:
- exploration window (default = 24 hrs) — The initial time that Autotune will evenly split traffic.


**Key Points:**

- Determining which product(s) to feature on a one-day Black Friday sale (resource = time, payout = revenue).

- Showing the best performing ad given a limited budget (resource = budget, payout = clicks/visits).

- Selecting the best signup flow given a finite amount of new users (resource = new users, payout = signups).

- Maximizing Gain:When resources are scarce and maximizing payoff is critical.

- Multiple Variations:Bandits are good at focusing traffic on the most promising variations. Bandits can be quite useful vs traditional A/B testing when there are >4 variations.

- winner threshold (default = 95%) — The confidence level Autotune will use to declare a winner and begin diverting 100% of traffic towards.

- statsig.logEvent(‘click’):Logs a successful click. This combined with getConfig() allows Autotune to compute the click-thru rate.

- Under an A/B/C/D test, 75% of the traffic would have been diverted to inferior variations (vs 42% for Autotune).

### 149. How Statsig Designs SDKs for Different Application Environments

**Date:** 2021-10-22T05:10:07.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in. Example: For example, our JavaScript client SDK is only12kb minified + Gzipped. #### At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

- 1. Serves a single user at a time

- 2. Not in a secure environment, i.e. assume everything is public

- 3. The device is not always connected to the Internet

- 4. Sensitive to binary size, data usage and latency

- 1. Serves many users from one machine

- 2. Each server runs for a long time

- Example: For example, our JavaScript client SDK is only12kb minified + Gzipped.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. Example: Try plugging your pitch into this template:
“[company]helps customers[verb] [business outcome]by[tech capability].”
For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”
### 2. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel.


**Key Points:**

- Sales is all about process.

- 1. Nail your pitch

- 2. Don’t reinvent the wheel

- 3. Warm up your leads

- 4. Be effective, not busy

- Example: Try plugging your pitch into this template:
“[company]helps customers[verb] [business outcome]by[tech capability].”
For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”

### 152. Embrace Overlapping A/B Tests and Avoid the Dangers of Isolating Experiments

**Date:** 2021-10-08T06:44:42.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/embracing-overlapping-a-b-tests-and-the-danger-of-isolating-experiments


**Summary:**  
How to handle simultaneous experiments frequently comes up. Example: For example, one cannot test new ranking algorithm A (vs control) and also new ranking algorithm B (vs control) in overlapping tests. This method maintains experimental power, but can reduce accuracy (as I’ll explain later, this is not a major drawback).


**Key Points:**

- Isolated tests— Users are split into segments, and each user is enrolled in only one experiment. Your experimental power is reduced, but accuracy of results are maintained.

- Microsoft’s Online Controlled Experiments At Scale

- How Google Conducts More experiments

- Can You Run Multiple AB Tests At The Same Time?

- Large Scale Experimentation at Spotify

- Running Multiple A/B Tests at The Same Time: Do’s and Dont’s

- AtStatsig, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting many experimentalists from different backgrounds and experiences.

### 153. Inside Look: Optimizing Conversion in E-commerce

**Date:** 2021-09-24T00:26:47.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-conversion-in-e-commerce


**Summary:**  
Today, I want to share an inside look into experimentation at a popular financial services company that offers payment processing services and APIs for e-commerce applications¹. Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience. This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.


**Key Points:**

- How experimentation moves the numbers in a popular payment processing company

- Experimentation is core to product development

- Experimentation with a smaller user base

- Choosing the right metrics

- All in on Experimentation

- Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience.

- This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.

### 156. My Five Favorite Things About Swift

**Date:** 2021-05-11T07:20:26.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/my-five-favorite-things-about-swift


**Summary:**  
I started doing iOS development at Facebook, which only used Objective-C for its iOS apps. Example: For example, instead of concatenating strings like this:
NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;
NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;
NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];
we can now do this:
let firstMsg = “Concatenating strings in Swift “
let secondMsg = “is EAZY”
let fullMsg = firstMsg + secondMsg
### 2. #### Statsigstrives to empower all developers to ship features faster, so naturally one of the first milestones for us was to provide an SDK for iOS development.


**Key Points:**

- optional parameters and labels

- 1. Swift is much more readable

- 2. Swift supports modern language features

- 3. No more header files!

- 4. Some nice quirks that I didn’t know I wanted

- 5. Easy to port to Objective-C

- Example: For example, instead of concatenating strings like this:
NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;
NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;
NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];
we can now do this:
let firstMsg = “Concatenating strings in Swift “
let secondMsg = “is EAZY”
let fullMsg = firstMsg + secondMsg

### 1. Experiments with AI in the Creative Process

**Date:** 2025-10-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cat Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experiments-with-ai-creative


**Summary:**  
In-house OOH campaigns are rare opportunities to exercise creativity beyond the usual brand tone. They can be tailored to their context - location, audience, event - and reframe a brand's core narrative. Example: (For example, uploading a picture of a pit stop wheel gun would generate something that looked like a hair dryer.)
Even after getting the generated image "close enough," the resolution was low, edges were messy, and details were off. Ultimately we found that using AI helped us increase ourcreative velocity: the speed at which our ideas could become real and move to execution.


**Key Points:**

- Quickly generate images to communicate concepts

- Create numerous copy variations to expand our brainstorms

- Research contextually relevant information

- Clarify your vision first—creative direction is keyThis is the pivotal point in the creative process where you either use AI creatively or let AI be creative for you.

- Use AI to optimize for AIOnce you've set a clear creative direction, refine your language to work with the specific image generation models you're using.

- Early Phase: Concept Development

- Mid Phase: Fleshing out a direction

- Key learnings for prompting

### 6. How we created count distinct in Statsig Cloud

**Date:** 2025-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Aamodit Acharya  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-we-created-count-distinct-in-statsig-cloud


**Summary:**  
When I joined Statsig, I spent my first week reading through customer requests. Almost immediately, a pattern jumped out to me. Unique artists in the first 7 days.


**Key Points:**

- Distinct artists listened per user

- Distinct SKUs purchased per user

- Distinct search queries issued per user

- Distinct repositories pushed per user

- Distinct merchants paid per user

- Wed: viewed {A}If you summed daily distincts you would get 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.Merging the three sketches yields {A, B, C}, which is 3.

- I kept the core model in Spark SQL and stored each day’s sketch as a base64 string in Parquet on GCS so it can safely move through BigQuery tables when needed.

- On the Spark side, I decode that field back into a native sketch and continue merges and extraction with the Spark UDFs and helpers.

### 7. Sink, swim, or scale: What startups teach us about launching AI

**Date:** 2025-08-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Alexey Komissarouk  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-startups-lessons-learned


**Summary:**  
About the guest author.Alexey Komissarouk is aGrowth Engineering Advisorwho teachesGrowth Engineering on Reforge. Previously, he was the Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Early users, however, complained they “still didn’t know what to do with this thing.”Notion pivotedfrom “AI writes for you” to “AI improves what you’ve already written,” redesigned starter prompts, and saw usage rise as the mental cost of exploration dropped.


**Key Points:**

- Pre‑negotiate burst capacity with vendors (spot GPUs, secondary clouds, reseller credits) so you scale up within minutes without surprise bills.

- Offer a “happy hour” off‑peak tier that absorbs hobby traffic without harming premium latency.

- Replace blank prompt boxes with role‑based starter chips and one‑click examples that autofill.

- Instrument “prompt redo” and “undo” events as frustration signals; run weekly funnel reviews on them.

- Offer an “explain my last prompt” toggle—turning trial‑and‑error into guided learning.

- When financially viable, start with a flat plan that eliminates mental transaction costs; layer in usage-based overages only once users reach actual ceilings.

- Expose “token burn so far” inside the interface, not tucked away in billing dashboards.

- Run price‑sensitivity experiments onengagedcohorts, not top‑of‑funnel sign‑ups; willingness to pay lags perceived mastery.

### 9. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. Example: Another great example is Notion AI, which writes and summarizes within your existing workspace. Keep response time below 200 ms and uptime above 99.9 %, and you’ve passed.


**Key Points:**

- Google's Geminioutperformed GPT-4 on 30 of 32 benchmarksand beat humans on language understanding tests. Once deployed, it suggestedadding glue to pizzato make cheese stick better.

- Perplexity faced lawsuitsforcreating fake news sectionsand falsely attributing content to real publications.

- Note: We recently launched our Evals product that solves this problem - clickhereto learn more

- Monitor success metrics.These metrics become your real quality benchmarks. The easiest way to do this is with product analytics.

- Watch user sessions.Record user interactions to understand the stories behind metrics - why users drop off, where confusion occurs, when they ignore AI suggestions.

- Ship big changes as A/B tests.Do 50/50 rollouts of what you think will be big wins to quantify the impact. This helps your team build intuition for what actually moves the needle.

- Expand.Ship features to larger and larger groups of users, monitoring success metrics and bad outcomes as you go.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

### 10. Randomization: The ABC’s of A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-06-30T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it? Example: This example underscores the critical importance of random allocation. It may also be influenced by infrastructure constraints (e.g., if the company’s allocation system only supports online assignment) or performance considerations (e.g., offline assignment may reduce runtimes).


**Key Points:**

- (A) Simple Randomization:Randomly assign users into two groups without considering balancing factors.

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

- Simple randomization: just go with the flow

- Seed randomization: Take your best shot

- Stratified randomization: Be a control freak

- ‍Which randomization method should you use?

- 1. Which users are participating in the experiment?

### 11. You can have it all: Parallel testing with A/B tests

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel. By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.


**Key Points:**

- Why test in parallel?

- What should you watch out for?

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel.

- By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.

**Author:** Israel Ben Baruch  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/move-forward-the-a-b-testing-mindset-guide


**Summary:**  
Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time. It sharpens your thinking and helps you act faster if your current test fails.


**Key Points:**

- Be obsessed.You check results more than you should. You run through your funnels again and again. Your head swarms with ideas. You’re not crazy, you’re exactly where you should be.

- Organizational culture.Your mindset needs an organization that supports it - one that encourages people to take risks, experiment, and always push forward.

- Professional expertise.CRO is a craft. Find the people, the content, and the companies to learn from. Apply. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. Most importantly: keep evolving.

- Great tools.Use high-quality, reliable measurement and testing platforms. They’re the foundation of effective testing. No compromises.

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

### 13. Experimentation and AI: 4 trends we’re seeing 

**Date:** 2025-06-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. Example: Example: It has become common for chat interface-based apps (like ChatGPT, Vercel V0, Lovable) to experiment with suggested prompts to help users quickly discover and realize value, which subsequently drives engagement and retention.


**Key Points:**

- Good logging on all the product metrics you care about

- The ability to link these metrics to everything you release

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

- Trend 2: More AI code drives the need for quantitative optimization

- Trend 3: Every engineer is a growth engineer

- Trend 4: Product value comes from your unique context

- Closing thoughts: AI is part of every product

### 14. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. Example: For example, if you were a developer seeing this code, it felt like choosing between the black wire and the red wire to cut if you had a time bomb in front of you:
There was even one time when someone accidentally set production services to connect to ourlatest(dev-stage) Redis instance instead of the correct prod one. It was time to build a tool that would help us move faster and safer.


**Key Points:**

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

- First, a developer pushes changes to a repo (call it Service X).

- Automated regional rollouts, powered by StatsigRelease Pipelines

- Shadow pipeline simulations

- Cost-based VM selection automation

- Highly manual configuration

- Disconnected dependencies

### 15. Why data and intuition aren&#39;t enemies

**Date:** 2025-05-30T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Laurel Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-data-and-intuition-arent-enemies


**Summary:**  
I’ve always been excited by the power of data storytelling. Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example. Metrics are often consulted only when something breaks, not when there is an opportunity to improve.


**Key Points:**

- Great products come from intuition guided by data, not intuition versus data.

- The uphill battle for metrics adoption

- Reframing the relationship between data and intuition

- The adaptive nature of good metrics

- Moving forward with adaptive taste

- Finding a data-informed culture at Statsig

- Product manager playbook

- Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example.

### 16. Empowering your team is the future of product leadership

**Date:** 2025-05-28T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. Paradoxically,trying to control everything actually reduces your control over what matters most.


**Key Points:**

- Defining outcomes that matter rather than dictating every task

- Providing context about user needs and business priorities

- Creating frameworks that enable autonomous decision-making

- Trusting your engineers to determine the "how" once they understand the "why"

- The challenge of proving value

- The two paths for product leaders

- The brute force PM

- The force-multiplier leader

### 17. Simulating Bigtable in BigQuery with Type 2 SCD modeling

**Date:** 2025-05-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Example: For example, “How does user behavior on our app change before, during, and after they obtain a premium subscription?”
We also need to store these updates in aversioned mannersince customers often want to observe how user behavior changes over time or with different properties. Bigtable’s write path also comfortably sustains millions of QPS, so cross‑region replication keeps read latency below 10 ms no matter wherever the request originates, letting us replicate it in near real-time.


**Key Points:**

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- User-property updates are generated in one of two ways (in blue). Customers either set up bulk uploads in our web console, or they use our SDKS to log them at run-time.

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

- Then, we have a Dataflow that reads those updates from Bigtable CDC, and streams those to BigQuery in near real-time.

- The current state of the Bigtable:

- The state of the Bigtable at some moment in time:

- How some property has changed over time:

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

### 18. Chasing metrics, not tasks: Why outcome-obsessed PMs win

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. One of my focus areas was improving our customer acquisition funnel.


**Key Points:**

- Misaligned incentives:Measuring success by task completion rather than outcome impact reinforced a culture of checking boxes rather than driving real business results.

- Letting go of sunk costs:When the data shows an initiative isn’t working, cut it – no matter how much time you’ve invested.

- Zooming out regularly:That metric you’ve been optimizing might not be the one that matters most. Don’t miss the forest for the trees.

- My metrics-focused foundation

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- The roadmap is a false comfort

- The buy-in breakthrough

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 19. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- How do you interpret the outcome of a non-inferiority test?

- How do you properly integrate non-inferiority tests into your company's A/B testing process?

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

- Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine.

- In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.

### 20. Fail faster, learn faster: Why &#34;done&#34; beats &#34;perfect&#34; in modern product management

**Date:** 2025-05-20T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. Shipping thin slices lets you take more at-bats, improve your swing, and learn from each attempt.


**Key Points:**

- Create feedback loops to build learnings from users quickly

- Limit the potential downsides if a feature underperforms and course correct

- Build stakeholder confidence by showing visible progress

- Collect real-world feedback that no amount of planning can substitute for

- Build organizational muscle memory for rapid learning

- Create space for high-risk, high-reward ideas that might be killed in a "perfect first time" culture

- Free up resources to pursue more opportunities rather than polishing a single feature

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

- Rajeev Rajan, CTO at Atlassian and former VP of Engineering at Facebook and Microsoft

- Howie Xu, Chief AI & Innovation Officer at Gen, founder of VMware’s networking division, and AI-focused investor and lecturer at Stanford

- Ami: At WhatsApp, the focus was on reliability and making the product feel like a utility or physical object. Fewer tests, fewer changes, and a relentless commitment to stability.

- Rajeev: Atlassian steers clear of sweeping UI overhauls in Jira. “It’s like redesigning a car dashboard—you can’t mess with muscle memory.”

- Ami: “Stay on the frontier of learning. It never feels good to be bad at something—but that’s where the learning starts.”

- Rajeev: “Forget the next title. Write the book of your life—what story do you want to tell?”

- Howie: “The new skill is TQ—token quotient. The more you engage with AI tools, the more prepared you’ll be.”

### 24. Continuous promotion for infrastructure with Statsig and Pulumi

**Date:** 2025-04-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics.


**Key Points:**

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

- Deployments that must be paused for manual sign‑off orchange‑management windows

- Initialize the Statsig server SDK at the start of your deployment.

- Get deployment decision from feature flags or dynamic configs.

- Deploy the target resources.

- Approve:Manually green‑light the next phase once metrics look good.

- Pause:Hold the rollout at the current phase to gather more data or schedule windows.

### 25. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. But when CVR improves while retention craters, the illusion breaks.


**Key Points:**

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

- Hidden cost of partial coverage:blind spots compound. Teams over‑index on the few things they do measure, and leadership starts believing an incomplete trend line.

- Integrate feature flags and experiments so every featurecanbe a testby default.

- Align engineering KPIs with metrics impact, not feature launch.

- Sunset legacy code that cannot be instrumented; it taxes every future decision.

- Why enterprises struggle:each domain team owns a slice of data; merging them requires cross‑org agreements and latency‑tolerant pipelines.

- Metrics is the language of the company. Make them clear and transparent with a centralized catalog.

- For experiments, pick a couple of primary metrics and a few guardrail metrics. Try to standardize across similar experiments.

### 26. Release pipelines: Safer, staged rollouts across your infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-04-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/release-pipelines


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we believe you can move fastwithoutbreaking things. Your 1% of users could be distributed across hundreds of clusters, and if this change causes unexpected behavior in production, it could bring down your entire infrastructure stack, as every server experiences the increased CPU and memory usage.


**Key Points:**

- Roll out changes environment by environment (dev → staging → prod)

- Target specific infrastructure segments within environments (prod-us-west → prod-us-east → prod-eu)

- Control progression between stages with time intervals or manual approvals

- Monitor each stage before proceeding to the next

- Roll back instantly if issues arise at any stage

- Catch issues early, before they affect a large portion of your infrastructure

- Prevent cascading failuresacross your entire system, ensuring higher uptime

- Validate changes in real production environmentswith minimal risk

### 27. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Example: Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:
Figure 3:A P95 performance graph comparing our legacy Node SDK (green) and Node Core SDK (blue) runtime for a gate check. With Rust's memory safety, performance, concurrency, and zero-cost abstractions, the improvements to actual evaluation time have been huge enough to outweigh the binding costs.


**Key Points:**

- pyo3 (Python):Getting started - PyO3 user guide

- napi-rs (Node):Getting started – NAPI-RS

- jni-rs (Java):GitHub - jni-rs/jni-rs: Rust bindings to the Java Native Interface

- ruslter (Elixir):GitHub - rusterlium/rustler: Safe Rust bridge for creating Erlang NIF functions

- What we learned

- Join the Slack community

### 28. The rise of experimentation as the industry standard

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. Example: One notable example is the16-month TV advertising experimentAmazon ran in a few markets, which showed that TV ads delivered only a modest sales bump. In the new model we grow bylearning faster—hundreds of tiny, controlled bets that compound.


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- Experimenting with the length of forms to mitigate user dropoffs

- Using 20% of an email audience to suss out the best email subject line and sending it to the remaining 80%

- Testingvirtually anythingin a focus group

- Implementing customer surveys to gauge reactions to potential upcoming initiatives

- Jeff Bezos on the importance of experimentation

- A booming market for experimentation platforms like Statsig

- Examples of high-impact experiments

### 29. Digital marketing attribution models: A tech survey

**Date:** 2025-04-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. Example: Early versions were still rule-based (for example, splitting credit evenly or favoring the first and last touches). MMM emerged in the 1950s (though it rose to popularity in the 1980s) as a top-down approach that uses aggregate data and statistical regression to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel to sales [1].


**Key Points:**

- Shapley Value Attribution

- Algorithmic/Statistical Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ML)

- Incrementality Testing and Lift Models

- Causal Inference-Based Multi-Channel Attribution

- Customer Journey-based Deep Learning Models

- Captures sequential nature of journeys.

- Explains results via the “If we remove channel X, how many conversions are lost?” logic, which is intuitive.

- More nuanced than any single-position rule; channels that primarily appear in converting paths get more credit.

### 30. ⚠️ Top secret hackathon projects from Q1 2025

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hackathon-projects-q1-2025


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, Hackathons are quarterly events where employees set aside their usual work to build anything they want—whether it’s an experimental feature, a wild automation, or a just-for-fun internal tool. Example: In one example, the team asked it to locate stale gates and remove them. ## 📈 Analytics and experimentation

### 31. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Example: For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:
On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of. We also have tools likeCUPEDthat will control for values that we can see before the experiment, avoiding the worst of the bias and making your experiments run faster.


**Key Points:**

- You have to choose experiments that can be applied across pages, and that you'd expect to have a similar impact on each of the pages you'd apply it to.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

- Image optimizations,such as enabling lazy loading across all pages.

- Multimedia enhancements,like adding audio versions of blog posts to see if this boosts engagement or traffic.

- Challenges of SEO A/B testing

- Designing your experiment

- Sidecar no-code A/B testing

- The right tools for the job

### 32. Why A/B testing is ultimately qualitative

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-ab-testing-is-ultimately-qualitative


**Summary:**  
People with diverse perspectives have to debate options in a room, weighing pros and cons between multiple (sometimes conflicting) objectives, many of which can't be captured in a single metric.


**Key Points:**

- Start with a purpose: Don’t run experiments without a well-considered hypothesis. Don't just think aboutwhatmetrics will move, think aboutwhythey might move.

- Invite broader feedback: Listen to stakeholders who might have non-quantitative insights. They may spot factors that algorithms or dashboards might miss.

- Frame decisions as trade-offs: A/B tests often reveal gains in one metric at the expense of another. Bring in qualitative judgments about which trade-offs matter most.

- Understanding the bigger picture

- The limitations of data and the role of expert judgment

- A balanced approach: Numbers and narrative

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

### 33. Introducing CURE: Smarter regression, faster experiments

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/announcing-cure


**Summary:**  
Statsig is excited to announce that we’re moving out of beta testing and into full production launch for CURE - an extension of CUPED - which allows users to add arbitrary covariate data to regression adjustment in their experiments, reducing variance even further than existing CUPED implementations. Example: For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results. For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED: Controlled [Experiment] Using Pre-Experiment Data

- CURE: [Variance] Control Using Regression Estimates

- If you have a predictive model of future behaviors, you can easilyuse that as a covariate in CURE(like Doordash’s CUPAC)

- If you want to provide additional signal to the standard CUPAC approach, you canpick and choose different user attributes or behaviorsto add to the regression

- CURE brings powerful, flexible regression adjustment to every Statsig experiment.

### 38. What no one tells you about feature flags and messy code

**Date:** 2025-03-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others. Example: Let's walk through an example. For example, if the flag is being used to slowly roll out a new checkout experience, and you're aiming for 100% rollout by the end of the month, create a “Removeff_new_checkout” ticket with a due date 30–45 days after full rollout.


**Key Points:**

- [ ] Remove all `if/else` conditions using `ff_new_checkout`

- [ ] Delete the flag from Statsig’s dashboard (mark as deprecated first)

- [ ] Remove related experiment code or tracking if applicable

- [ ] Update documentation or `FLAGS.md` if needed

- [ ] Confirmation that no users are on the legacy flow

- [ ] No recent rollbacks in the past 14 days

- When should this flag be removed?

- Who’s responsible for removing it?

### 39. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. - Tightening the Confidence (Credible) Interval:Alternatively, one can choose a narrower prior that reduces uncertainty in the posterior distribution.


**Key Points:**

- The choice of priors can strongly influence the resulting posterior estimates, requiring careful calibration to avoid unintentionally skewing the analysis.

- Neither type of informed Bayesian approach is “wrong” in principle, but the first introduces a greater risk of data manipulation, while the second can slow down decision-making.

- In many cases, the second approach is effectively equivalent to applying FDR-type frequentist adjustments and often yields the same outcomes, just framed in Bayesian terms.

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

- 1. Introduction

- 2. Literature review

- 2.1 Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches in A/B tests

- 2.2 Two types of informed bayesian adjustments

**Author:** Matt Garnes  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experiment-quality-score


**Summary:**  
They have their own platform for evaluating which experiments adhere to best practices, but the biggest challenge was getting each team to look in two places for information about how they were doing. Measuringexperiment quality over timealso helps teamstrack improvements in their experimentation processand level up their decision-making confidence.


**Key Points:**

- Building is better with friends

- What is the experiment quality score?

- How to enable and configure experiment quality score

- Where to view the experiment quality score

- Measuringexperiment quality over timealso helps teamstrack improvements in their experimentation processand level up their decision-making confidence.

### 41. Why buying an experimentation platform makes more sense than building one

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/buying-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
“Building your own experimentation platform made a lot of sense… five years ago,” says our customer Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager - Core ML at Whatnot, who previously worked on DoorDash’s in-house platform. Example: For example, over the past year we’ve shipped several advanced capabilities that you won’t find in a typical experimentation platform:
- Stats methodologies such as stratified sampling, differential impact detection, interaction detection, Benjamini Hochberg procedure etc. Over the past few years, several companies have moved away from in-house experimentation tooling and turned to Statsig to scale their experimentation cultures.Notionincreased their experimentation velocity by 30x within a year.Limewent from limited testing to experimenting on every change before rolling it out.


**Key Points:**

- Server & client-side SDKsfor seamless experimentation across all surfaces without impacting performance

- Data logging, ingestion and processing servicesand/or integration with your data warehouse

- Randomization functionsfor accurate user allocations in different scenarios

- Experiment result computationsincluding metric lifts, p-values, confidence intervals, and other statistical calculations

- Automated checks(like power analysis, balanced exposures) to ensure experiments are properly set up and issues are identified proactively

- Statistical correctionsto account for outliers, pre-experimental bias, and differential impact, etc. to provide trustworthy results

- Variance reduction(CUPED, winsorization)

- Experimentation techniqueslike sequential testing, switchback testing, geo-based tests etc.

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/data-driven-marketing-attribution-shortcomings


**Summary:**  
Ideally, you’d like a tidy calculation that says, “Channel A accounts for 25% of conversions, Channel B for 40%, Channel C for 10%,” and so on.


**Key Points:**

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

- The problem: Evaluating marketing spend in a complex landscape

- What data-driven models promise

- Where they fall short in reality

### 44. Automating BigQuery load jobs from GCS: Our scalable approach

**Date:** 2025-03-06T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/automating-bigquery-load-jobs-gcs


**Summary:**  
As our data needs evolved, we created a flexible and dynamic ingestion solution. Example: Example:
## Orchestrating workflows
We use an orchestrator configured to trigger our Python ingestion script periodically, following a cron-like schedule. Time-based bucketing of files
We organize incoming data into discrete time buckets (e.g., every 1,000 seconds).


**Key Points:**

- Automatically detect and ingest data into new tables dynamically.

- Group files into time-based buckets for organized ingestion.

- Reliably track ingestion jobs, accounting for potential delays in status reporting.

- BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS:for historical job statuses and to identify completed or failed jobs.

- MongoDB:for tracking pending and initiated jobs to mitigate delays in BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA updates.

- bq_load_source_bucket_name: Indicates the originating bucket for the load job.

- bq_load_dest_table_name: Indicates the destination table for the load job.

- bq_load_bucket_timestamp: Indicates the specific time bucket processed.

### 45. KPI traps: How &#34;successful&#34; experiments can still be failures

**Date:** 2025-03-05T00:02-08:00  
**Author:** Lin Jia  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kpi-traps-successful-experiments-can-fail


**Summary:**  
You set up the experiment cautiously, collected data diligently, and celebrated when it achieved statistical significance for your KPI. Example: For example, a company notices that customer service calls are taking too long. When they run a two-week experiment to measure the impact, they find that DAU increases as more users return to the app.


**Key Points:**

- Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever.

- Success on paper, but failure in practice

- False positive risk

- False positive risk given the success rate, p-value threshold of 0.025 (successes only), and 80% power

- How to avoid KPI traps

- Align KPIs with business goals

- Use multiple metrics including high-level objective, user behaviors, and guardrails

- Monitor long-term effects for shipped experiments

### 47. Beyond prompts: A data-driven approach to LLM optimization

**Date:** 2025-03-04T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Anna Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/llm-optimization-online-experimentation


**Summary:**  
This article presents a systematic framework for online A/B testing of LLM applications, focusing onprompt engineering, model selection, and temperature tuning. Example: ## Experiment design and statistical rigor
### Hypothesis and goal
Define a measurable hypothesis: e.g., “Adding an example to the prompt will increase correct answer rates by 5%.” This clarity guides your metrics and success criteria. By isolating and experimenting with specific factors, teams can generate tangible improvements in performance, user engagement, and cost-efficiency.


**Key Points:**

- Improve performance: Validate hypothesis-driven changes (like new prompts) directly with real users.

- Reduce costs: Pinpoint “good enough” model variants or narrower context windows that maintain quality while lowering expenses.

- Boost engagement: Track user behaviors such as conversation length, retention, or click-through rates to ensure AI experiences resonate with users.

- Randomized user allocation: Users are split—often 50/50—so each group experiences only one variant. Randomization ensures a fair comparison.

- Single variable isolation: If testing a new prompt, keep the model and temperature consistent across both variants to attribute outcome differences to prompt changes.

- A different base model (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5).

- A refined prompt with new instructions or examples.

- Altered parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p).

### 48. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Vercel Native Integration

**Date:** 2025-02-27T07:00-12:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-vercel-native-integration


**Summary:**  
Modern web development depends on a seamless experience for users and developers. Performant, fast, and reliable websites are table stakes for users in 2025.At the same time, websites and applications are becoming increasingly complex, with more features, integrations, and components contributing to the user experience. Example: For example, if you're introducing a new navigation layout, you can first enable the flag for internal users, gather feedback, and then gradually roll it out to production—all without pushing a new deployment. No developer wants to manage extra configurations, third-party dashboards, or custom integrations, and no user wants to see a page flicker on load, or experience another 100ms wait until the page renders.


**Key Points:**

- Create and manage feature flagsto control your releases

- Run experimentsto test changes and measure impact

- Gain access to Analytics, Session Replay, and other Statsig product toolsthat don’t exist natively in your Vercel dashboard

- Use Statsig’s SDKs and Edge Config syncingfor low-latency performance without additional setup

- Install the integration:Find Statsig in the Vercel Marketplace and complete the quick setup flow

- Choose a billing plan:Both plans offer generous limits: theFree tierincludes 2M events/month, while thePro tierprovides 5M events/month for just $150

- Install Statsig and connect your Statsig project: Link your Statsig project to Vercel to sync feature flags, experiments, settings, permissions, etc.

- Initialize with Vercel’s Flags SDK or Statsig's SDK:We recommend using Vercel's Flags SDK for Next.js and SvelteKit projects; use Statsig’s SDK for all other projects

Yet, people still confuse correlation with causation all the time. Example: For example, this upsell that claims “4x” profile views as promised by LinkedIn Premium is definitely more correlation than causation. The trouble starts when people try to lock down a specific metric or target, like the famous claim thatadding more than 10 friends in 7 days is the key to Facebook’s engagement.


**Key Points:**

- Spot most cases of confusionbetween correlation and causation and form a clear idea of where the errors might come from.

- Grasp the essence of causal inference modelsbased on observed data. You’ll see exactly when their assumptions hold and when they don’t.

- Fifteen-year-old children who took the pill grew an average of 3 inches in one year.

- In the same schools, fifteen-year-old children who didnottake the pill grew an average of 2 inches in one year.

- Families with more money can afford the pill and give their kids better nutrition.

- Families who choose the pill care more about healthy growth and use other measures.

- Families who opt for the pill have shorter kids to begin with, so they show more “catch-up” growth.

- Most of us have heard the phrase “correlation isn’t causation.”

### 50. What are guardrail metrics in A/B tests?

**Date:** 2025-02-26T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Michael Makris  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-are-guardrail-metrics-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Your team designed the feature well, you set ambitious business targets, you built the feature well, and designed a solid A/B test to measure the results. Example: For example, if you're testing a new user interface, your primary metric might be the click-through rate on a feature button. While you aim to improve specific aspects of your product through A/B testing, you shouldn’t compromise on the overall system and business health.


**Key Points:**

- Ensuring that gains in one area do not cause losses in another

- Providing a holistic view of the impact of your tests

- Interactions with other features

- Envision the following:

- Introduction to guardrail metrics in A/B testing

### 52. Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics: Not a big deal?

**Date:** 2025-02-11T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-vs-frequentist-statistics


**Summary:**  
One common area of confusion and heated debate is the difference betweenBayesian and Frequentist approaches. In theory, they offer several advantages:
- Faster, more accurate decision-making
Faster, more accurate decision-making
- The ability to leverage past information
The ability to leverage past information
- A structured way to debate underlying assumptions
A structured way to debate underlying assumptions
Because of these benefits, some advocate for their adoption including data scientists at companies like Amazon and Netflix (ref).


**Key Points:**

- The unknown is fixed:Thetrueaverage height of adults in your city isn't changing while you're analyzing your data. It's a fixed, albeit unknown, number.

- Randomness is in the data:The randomness comes fromwhichpeople you happen to sample. If you repeated your survey many times, you'd get slightly different results each time.

- Frequentists:Focus on the long-run frequency of events. Probability is about how often something would happen if you repeated the experiment many times.

- Bayesians:Focus on the degree of belief or certainty about an unknown. Probability is a measure of how likely something is, given your current knowledge.

- Large samples:When you have a lot of data, Bayesian and Frequentist approaches tend to give very similar results. The data overwhelms any prior beliefs in the Bayesian approach.

- A Frequentist might see if a 95% confidence interval for the difference in conversion rates excludes zero.

- A Bayesian might see if a 95% credible interval for the difference lies entirely above zero.

- In most cases, they'll reach the same conclusion about which version is better.

### 58. Settings 2.0: Keeping up with a scaling product

**Date:** 2025-01-29T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Cynthia Xin  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/settings-page-design-2025


**Summary:**  
Over the past few years, Statsig has scaled significantly, adding multiple products and features to our platform. Example: In Settings 1.0, the left-side navigation menu was essentially broken down into "project" and "organization."
If users wanted to edit settings for a feature gate, for example, they needed to remember which settings were considered project settings versus organization settings, often resulting in users having to navigate different tabs just to track down one toggle. ### UI simplification
We updated the UI in Settings 2.0 to improve usability while adhering toour latest design system, Pluto.


**Key Points:**

- Members > Select a Team > Edit Team Settings

- Organization Info > Gate Settings

- Settings 2.0 introduces a main navigation and a sub-navigation

- Users can easily switch between Team, Project, and Organization settings for product features by using the sub-navigation

- We recently embarked on a journey to make our Settings page even better.

- Intuitive navigation (Product first, permission level second)

- Consolidating members, teams, and roles

- UI simplification

### 59. The ultimate guide to building an internal feature flagging system

**Date:** 2025-01-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
“Why do people pay for this?”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions. Example: You’re also likely to find some synergies in the code you write across these two services - for example, the service that provides evaluated flag values to clients can borrow logic from the code that evaluates rulesets on your servers, provided they’re written in the same language. - Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?


**Key Points:**

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

- Handle targeting on any user trait, like app version, country, IP address, etc.?

- Have extremely high uptime?

- test a feature in production (by “gating” it to only employees/ beta testers)

- rollout a feature to only certain geographies (by “gating” on user countries)

- run an A/B test (by gating a feature to a random 50% of userIDs)

- Or Run acanary release(release a feature to a random 10% of userIDs, to check that it doesn’t break anything)

### 60. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. Example: For example, if most control exposures come from the US while the test group is evenly split between EU and US, the issue might be linked to the SDK in the EU release. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users.


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Why it’s important

- Our new debugging capabilities

### 61. Detecting interaction effects of concurrent experiments

**Date:** 2025-01-13T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Kane Luo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/interaction-effect-detection


**Summary:**  
To accelerate experimentation, medium to large companies run hundreds of A/B tests simultaneously, aiming to isolate and measure the impact of each change, also known as the "main effect."
However, when multiple tests target the same area of your product, they can influence one another, resulting in either overestimation or underestimation of metric changes. Example: For example, to understand the effect of dark mode without the transition animation, you would compare group C to group A using a standard two-sample t-test. This expands the UI compatibility and aims to improve retention.


**Key Points:**

- Relaunch the same experimentsto a mutually exclusive audience. This is especially useful if you need more statistical power particularly on secondary metrics.

- Conduct manual statistical testsand determine which one of the two features to ship.

- If the interaction is synergistic, you candouble down on the combined experience, by either launching a new test or analyzing group A and D.

- Rework the experienceto make the feature compatible.

- Statsig now offersinteraction effect detectionto uncover the hidden effects of experiments on each other.

- Scenario: Dark mode gone wrong

- How do we diagnose it?

- My experiments are interacting—now what?

**Date:** 2025-01-01T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/key-problems-in-d2c-that-experimentation-solves


**Summary:**  
“Half your ideas will fail… you need to verify and tweak your ideas until they actually deliver value for the customer.”
– Wyatt Thompson, Dollar Shave Club
## Why D2C brands face unique challenges
Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands thrive by forging direct relationships with customers—yet this also makes them vulnerable to every friction point along the user journey. Example: For example, small tweaks to the timing or format of promotional emails can reduce churn and encourage repeat purchases within 28 days. keyword-based) or surface trending bundles (“Complete the look”) to see which approach not only increases product visibility but also boosts average order value.


**Key Points:**

- For direct-to-consumer brands, data-driven testing is the real game-changer.

- Why D2C brands face unique challenges

- Friction during first-time conversions

- Overlooked opportunities in product discovery

### 64. One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/one-tailed-vs-two-tailed-tests


**Summary:**  
If your answer is no—or if you’re not even sure what this means—then this blog is for you! Example: Reviewing the previous graph can help illustrate this: for example, a result in the left tail might be significant under a two-tailed hypothesis but not under a right one-tailed hypothesis. Note that the purple area is larger for the one-tailed hypothesis, compared to the two-tailed hypothesis:
In practice, to maintain the desired power level, we compensate for the reduced power of a two-tailed hypothesis by increasing the sample size (Increasing sample size raises power, though the mechanics of this can be a topic for a separate article).


**Key Points:**

- One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Hypothesis Testing: Understanding the Difference

- Why does it make a difference?

- How to decide between one-tailed and two-tailed hypothesis?

### 65. When allocation point and exposure point differ

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/when-allocation-point-and-exposure-point-differ


**Summary:**  
Since this feature isn’t visible when the page loads, users in the test group might leave before scrolling down to see it. Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not. If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.


**Key Points:**

- Why does it happen?

- Why does it matter?

- What should you do?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not.

- If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.

### 67. You don&#39;t need large sample sizes to run A/B tests

**Date:** 2024-12-12T03:15+00:00  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/you-dont-need-large-sample-sizes-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Yet many small and medium-sized companies aren’t running A/B Tests. Example: Google routinely runs large search tests on a massive scale, for example 100,000,000 users where a+0.1% effect on topline metrics is a big win. A/B testing is a pillar of data-driven product development irrespective of the product’s size
### Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing
Startup companies have a major advantage in experimentation:huge potential and upside.Startups don’t play the micro-optimization game; they don’t care about a +0.2% increase in click-through rates.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED(Controlled Experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) leverages historical metrics to reduce noise and refine your estimates.

- Stratified Samplingensures balanced and reliable comparisons across small, skewed user segments.

- Differential Impactcan reveal directional and qualitative findings, providing a little more color to the results of your experiment.

- Small companies’ secret advantage in experimentation

- Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing

- Bayesian A/B test calculator

- Google vs a startup: Who has more statistical power?

### 71. How A/B testing platforms make data science more interesting

**Date:** 2024-10-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-ab-testing-platforms-make-data-science-more-interesting


**Summary:**  
A/B testing platforms have become highly efficient, automating much of the mundane work involved in setting up, calculating, and reporting on experiments. Example: "An engineer that improves server performance by ten milliseconds more than pays for his or her fully loaded annual costs."
Illustrating the tangible impact of small improvements, Kohavi shared this powerful example. ## Excerpts
"Most experiments fail to improve the metrics they were designed to improve."
Kohavi highlighted a counterintuitive reality: the majority of experiments don't yield the expected positive results.


**Key Points:**

- What’s the current state of experimentation automation since the release of the Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (the "Hippo" book)?

- How does this automation impact the role of data scientists?

- What should data scientists focus on moving forward?

- How can we secure leadership buy-in for experimentation efforts?

- Over the past few years, the data science landscape has fundamentally changed.

- My questions to Ronny:

- Three takeaways

- Experimentation automation benefits data scientists both directly and indirectly

### 73. Introducing experimental meta-analysis and the knowledge base

**Date:** 2024-10-09T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimental-meta-analysis-and-knowledge-base


**Summary:**  
Over the past three years, we’ve seen several companies significantly scale their experimentation culture, often increasing their experimentation velocity by 10-30x within a year. Example: For example, if you’ve spent a quarter testing ways to optimize product recommendations in your e-commerce app, an individual experiment might guide a ship decision. Whatnot hit a run rate of 400 experiments last year,Notion scaled from single-digit to hundreds per quarter,Rec Room went from nearly zero to 150 experimentsin their first year with Statsig, andLime started testing every change they roll out.


**Key Points:**

- What experiments are running now?

- When are they expected to end?

- What % of experiments ship Control vs Test?

- What is the typical duration?

- Do experiments run for their planned duration or much longer or shorter?

- Do experiments impact key business metrics or only shallow or team-level metrics?

- How much do they impact key business metrics?

- The value of experimentation compounds as you run more experiments.

### 79. How much does a feature flag platform cost?

**Date:** 2024-09-23T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/comparing-feature-flag-platform-costs


**Summary:**  
To simplify the process, we’ve put togethera spreadsheet comparing pricing, complete with all the formulas we used and any assumptions we made.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig offers the lowest pricing across all usage levels, with free gates for non-analytics use cases (i.e., if a gate is used for an A/B test).

- Launch Darkly’s cost for client-side SDKs reachesthe highest levels across all platformsafter ~100k MAU.

- PostHog client-side SDK costs stand as the second cheapestacross feature flag platforms while still racking uphundreds of dollars for usage over 1M requests.

- The assumption of 20 sessions per MAU is made on the basis that each active user is assumed to have 20 unique sessions each month.

- One request per session is used, given a standard 1:1 ratio for requests and sessions.

- 20 gates instrumented per MAU made on the assumption of using 20 gates in a given product.

- 50% of gates checked each session is used as a benchmark on the basis of users only triggering half of the gates in a given session.

- One context (client-side users, devices, or organizations that encounter feature flags in a product within a month) per MAU given the close definition of the two.

### 80. Optimizing config propagation time with target apps

**Date:** 2024-09-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sam Miller  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-config-propagation-time-with-target-apps


**Summary:**  
Propagation latency is defined as the time it takes for a change made in the Console to be reflected by the config checks you issue on your frontend or backend systems with our SDKs. Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps.


**Key Points:**

- Performance: By filtering out irrelevant configurations, the payload sent to each SDK instance is smaller, leading to faster initialization times and lower memory usage

- At Statsig, we’re constantly finding ways to drive down what we call config propagation latency.

- What are target apps?

- Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps.

### 82. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Example: Funnels allow you to measure complex relationships with a higher degree of clarity.For example, you see revenue flatten, but product page views are going up. If you care about improving your checkout flow for products, tracking this data at a session level is more powerful, measuring (successes / tries) instead of (successful users / users who tried)
Consider when a user vs.


**Key Points:**

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- Statistical rigor:Make sure funnel conversions have the delta method applied and have sound practices for ordinal logic.

- Ordered events:For funnels to be really useful, you should be able to specify that users do events in a specific sequence over time.

- Multiple-step funnels:Two-step funnels can be useful, but the ability to add intermediate steps as needed for richer understanding is critical.

- Step-level and overall conversion changes:This is how you can identifywheredrop-offs happen.

- Calculation windows:Being able to specify the maximum duration a user has to finish a funnel is critical to running longer experiments.

### 83. CUPED Explained

**Date:** 2024-09-15T00:00-05:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped


**Summary:**  
MeaningControlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data, CUPED is frequently cited as—and used as—one of the most powerful algorithmic tools for increasing the speed and accuracy of experimentation programs. Example: In the example below, it’s pretty obvious that the difference in the groupsbeforethe test would make the results extremely skewed:
You might note that you can see that the weighted runners’ times went up, and the unweighted runners’ times went down. In this article, we’ll:
- Cover the background of CUPED
Cover the background of CUPED
- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
## What CUPED solves:
As an experiment matures and hits its target date for readout, it’s not uncommon to see a result that seems to beonly barelyoutside the range where it would be treated as statistical


**Key Points:**

- Cover the background of CUPED

- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED

- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments

- The effect size in our T-test (the delta between test and control) is exactly the same as the “test” variable’s coefficient in the OLS regression.

- The standard error for the coefficient is the same as the standard error for our T-test.

- The p-value for the “test” variable coefficient is the same as for our t-test!

- Our p-value goes from 0.116 to 0.000 because of the decreased Standard Error. The result, which was previously not statistically significant, is now clearly significant.

- Multiply the pre-experiment population mean byθand add it to each user’s result

**Date:** 2024-09-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Morgan Scalzo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-experimentation-infrastructure-and-culture-ronny-kohavi


**Summary:**  
We recently hosted a virtual meetup featuring Allon Korem, CEO ofBell, and Ronny Kohavi, awidely respected thought leaderand expert in experimentation. Example: For example, a p-value of 0.01 does not mean there is a 99% chance of success. - Experimentation culture: Establishing an organizational culture that embraces experimentation is vital for continuous growth and improvement.


**Key Points:**

- Case study: Only 12% of 1,000 experiments succeeded, illustrating the harsh reality that many organizations must accept—a high failure rate is normal.

- Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches: They covered the differences between these two statistical approaches and their applications in experimentation.

- A/A tests as best practice: RunningA/A testsis strongly recommended to validate experimentation setups and ensure the reliability of testing infrastructure.

- Asymmetric allocation: This approach can provide advantages to the larger group in an experiment, optimizing for specific outcomes.

- You can always learn something from people with lots of experience.

- Key insights from Ronny Kohavi

- Should every organization aim for "fly" in every category?

- Discussion on failures

### 86. How Meta made me a big-time A/B testing advocate

**Date:** 2024-09-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/meta-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
I wanted to show my data scientist audience how powerful Deltoid is, yet was prohibited from doing so as it’s an internal tool. Example: For example, inan earlier video, I discussed how AB testing shapes the meritocracy and competitive culture at Facebook. We found thatthe white background caused a decrease in click-through rate and conversion rate:It made users feel like they were in a traditional e-commerce experience, rather than browsing for deals.


**Key Points:**

- I recordedStatsig’s first public demoover three years ago.

- Measuring our failure

- Understanding our failure

- The difference a white background can make

- The counterfactual of no A/B testing

- Get started now!

## Other things to consider
When evaluating experimentation


**Key Points:**

- Monthly Active Users (MAU) act as a standardized benchmark across platforms. It is assumed that 100% of MAU are tracked (monthly tracked users (MTU))

- Each monthly user creates 20 unique sessions per month

- One request (or exposure event) is used per session

- 5 analytics events are used per session

- 20 gates are instrumented per session (this would mean that 20 gates exist within the product)

- 50% of gates are checked each session (meaning half of the 20 gates are used by the average user)

- Statsig and VWO offer the cheapest experimentation platform at low volumes (< 100K MAU)

- Statsig offers enterprise pricing starting at around 200K MAU, making it cheapest and most scalable option at higher volumes

### 88. Why Kayak lets you pick your plane

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kayak-aircraft-filter-feature


**Summary:**  
And neither were the passengers of Alaska Airlines flight 1282, whose emergency exit door fell out in January, forcing the pilot of the Boeing 737 Max to conduct an emergency landing. Example: Steve Hafner, the CEO of Kayak, goes on to say, “While the overall fraction of users filtering the 737 remains small, usage increased following the Alaska Airlines incident in January(15x compared to month prior from a low baseline), and it has since decreased until this past week (to 10x compared to Dec 2023).”
## What Kayak did right
This is a great example of companies reacting to user sentiment.

### 89. What is A/B testing and why is it important?

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-is-a-b-testing-and-why-is-it-important


**Summary:**  
Underlying AB testing is the concept of “randomized controlled trials (RCTs).” It is the gold standard in finding causality. Example: Let’s use one quick example, which also illustrates what “random assignment” is and its importance. ## Understanding treatment effect with an example
Suppose I claim that I have a magic pill that costs $100 and can increase the height of high school students by 1 inch over a year.


**Key Points:**

- With randomized assignments, the difference between the treatment group and the control group iscaused by the treatment.

- Test group:1000 students who voluntarily took the pill a year ago. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 62 inches this year.

- Control group:1000 students from the same schools with the same age. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 61 inches this year.

- Claim:We shipped a feature and metrics increased 10%

- Reality:The metrics will increase 10% without the feature, such as shipping a Black Friday banner before Black Friday.

- Claim:We shipped a feature, and users who use the feature saw 10% increase in their metrics

- Reality:The users who self-select into using the feature would see a 10% increase without the feature, such as giving a button to power users(ref: why most aha moments are wrong?)

- Humans are bad at attributions and are subject to lots of biases

### 91. Technical insights to a scalable experimentation system

**Date:** 2024-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/technical-insights-to-a-scalable-experimentation-system


**Summary:**  
(2022)highlighted, establishing trust in experimental results is challenging. Example: For example, a differential baseline between groups prior to a treatment is not statistically biased, but it is undesirable for making business decisions and usually requires resetting the test. In such cases, the cost of maintaining more experiments increases super-linearly, while the benefits increase sub-linearly.


**Key Points:**

- Historical Relevance:Experiments serve both decision-making and learning purposes, requiring a comprehensive understanding of both current and past experiments.

- Managerial incentives often encourage detrimental behaviors, such as p-hacking.

- Experiments may result in technical debt by leaving configurations within the codebase.

- The marginal return of experiments increases linearly or sub-linearly with scale, as less effort is available to turn information into impact.

- The marginal cost of experiments increases super-linearly with scale due to information and managerial overhead.

- Default-on experiments on all new features.

- Define metrics once, use everywhere.

- Reliable, traceable, and transparent data.

### 94. Why the uplift in A/B tests often differs from real-world results

**Date:** 2024-08-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-the-uplift-in-a-b-tests-often-differs-from-real-world


**Summary:**  
This disconnect can be puzzling and disappointing, especially when decisions and expectations are built around these tests. Example: A common example I’ve encountered with clients involves tests that yield inconclusive (non-significant) results. While reducing the significance level can decrease the number of false positives, it would also require longer test durations, which may not always be feasible.


**Key Points:**

- Human bias in analysis and interpretation

- False positives

- Sequential testing and overstated effect sizes

- Novelty effect and user behavior

- External validity and real-world factors

- Limited exposure in testing

- Strategies for mitigating discrepancies

### 96. How to pick metrics that make or break your experiments (including do&#39;s and don&#39;ts)

**Date:** 2024-08-14T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Elizabeth George  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-metrics-that-make-or-break-your-experiments


**Summary:**  
In fact, the wrong metrics can not only mislead your results but can also derail your entire strategy.


**Key Points:**

- Have a razor-sharp focus on one primary behavioral metric and a clearly aligned business metric.

- Anticipate and measure the negative consequences of your changes—because they’re inevitable.

- Use secondary metrics to fill in the gaps in your understanding. Without them, you’re operating in the dark.

- Ensure your experiment has enough power to provide conclusive, reliable results. Anything less is a waste of time.

- Stick with the same business metric for every experiment. If it doesn’t align with your specific goals, it’s irrelevant.

- Overcomplicate your analysis with a laundry list of metrics. Clarity and focus are your allies; distraction is your enemy.

- Over-interpret secondary data. If it’s not part of your primary hypothesis, it’s noise—don’t let it lead you astray.

- Your experiments are only as good as the metrics you choose.

### 97. How to plan test duration when using CUPED

**Date:** 2024-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-plan-test-duration-cuped


**Summary:**  
You understand that failing to plan the test duration can lead to underpowered tests and inflated false positive rates due to peeking. Example: Example:
In reality, we don't know the true values of the variables, so we must estimate them. Recently, you've been introduced toCUPED, an advanced statistical method that reduces KPI variance, resulting in more sensitive tests (lower MDE) or shorter test durations (lower sample size).


**Key Points:**

- Calculate the Non-CUPED Sample Size: Use the regular t-test sample size formula.

- Adjust Sample Size: Reduce the calculated sample size by the factor of \(\rho^2\).

- Suppose the non-CUPED sample size is 1000.

- Historical sampled data shows an estimated Pearson correlation of 0.9 between \(X\) and \(Y\).

- Calculate the variance reduction factor: \(0.9^2 = 0.81\).

- Adjust the sample size: \(1000 \times (1 - 0.81) = 190\).

- What is test planning and why is it important?

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-i-saved-my-experiment-from-outliers


**Summary:**  
This is why health checks are acriticalpart of an experimentation platform—the more you’re proactively alerted about potential issues, the less likely you are to make a bad ship decision—and worse (in this case), have a bad learning experience.


**Key Points:**

- Change/Add winsorization to manage the influence of these outlier users, or add metric caps to a reasonable number like 5 signup clicks/day

- Use an explore query or qualifying event filter to eliminate these two users from the analysis

- Use an event-user metric instead

### 105. Controlling your type I errors: Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg

**Date:** 2024-07-31T10:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/controlling-type-i-errors-bonferroni-benjamini-hochberg


**Summary:**  
TheBenjamini-Hochberg Procedureis now available on Statsig as a way to reduce your false positives. Example: - FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons
FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons
- FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it
FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it
For each metric evaluation of one variant vs the control, we have:
In any online experiment, we’re likely to have more than just 1 metric and one variant in a given experiment, for example:
We generally recommend the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure as a less severe measure than the Bonferroni Correction, but which still protects you from some amount Type I errors.


**Key Points:**

- (Type I Error) I’m making unnecessary changes that don’t actually improve our product.

- (Type II Error) I missed an opportunity to make our product better because I didn’t detect a difference in my experiment.

- FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons

- FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it

- Bonferroni vs Benjamini-Hochberg

- Try it with Statsig

### 106. Hypothesis Testing explained in 4 parts

**Date:** 2024-07-22T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-explained


**Summary:**  
As data scientists, Hypothesis Testing is expected to be well understood, but often not in reality. It is mainly because our textbooks blend two schools of thought – p-value and significance testing vs. Example: For example, some questions are not obvious unless you have thought through them before:
- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis? Third, to illustrate the two concepts concisely, let’s run a visualization by just changing the sample size from 30 to 100 and see how power increases from 86.3% to almost 100%.


**Key Points:**

- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis?

- Can we accept the null hypothesis? Why?

- How does MDE change with alpha holding beta constant?

- Why do we use standard error in Hypothesis Testing but not the standard deviation?

- Why can’t we be specific about the alternative hypothesis so we can properly model it?

- Why is the fundamental tradeoff of the Hypothesis Testing about mistake vs. discovery, not about alpha vs. beta?

- We emphasize a clear distinction between the standard deviation and the standard error, and why the latter is used in Hypothesis Testing

- We explain fully when can you “accept” a hypothesis, when shall you say “failing to reject” instead of “accept”, and why

### 108. Top 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them

**Date:** 2024-07-18T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/top-8-common-experimentation-mistakes-how-to-fix


**Summary:**  
I recently down with Allon Korem, CEO ofBell Statistics, and Tyler VanHaren, Software Engineer at Statsig, to discuss some of the most frequent mistakes companies can make in A/B testing and experimentation! I've summarized the discussion and outlined the 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them. By addressing these common testing mistakes, companies can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of their A/B tests.


**Key Points:**

- Data integrity:Ensure that your allocation point is consistent and verify your distributions using chi-squared tests to detect sample ratio mismatches.

- Skepticism and Vigilance:Regularly check data integrity over different segments and time periods to identify inconsistencies early.

- Proper Metrics:Collaborate with data science teams to ensure metrics are correctly defined and measured, focusing on meaningful business-driven KPIs.

- Statistical Methods:Use t-tests for means and z-tests for proportions in most cases. Ensure your statistical tests are relevant to your hypotheses.

- Peeking:Use sequential testing approaches to manage peeking. Tools like Statsig provide inflated confidence intervals for early data to mitigate premature conclusions.

- Underpowered Tests:Plan tests meticulously using power analysis calculators to ensure you have sufficient data to detect the expected changes.

- Handling Outliers:Use Windsorization to cap extreme values rather than removing outliers entirely, maintaining the integrity of your data.

- Cultural Challenges:Foster a culture that encourages upfront hypothesis formulation and continuous learning from experimentation.

### 109. Introducing Differential Impact Detection 

**Date:** 2024-07-17T09:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/differential-impact-detection


**Summary:**  
Statsig can now automatically surface heterogenous treatment effects across your user properties. In experimentation “one size fits all” is not always true. Example: For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users. For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users.


**Key Points:**

- Investigate the top sub-populations across each user property that you specify as a “Segment of Interest”

- For each primary metric in the experiment, determine if any sub-population has a different response to treatment

- Automatically surface a visualization of metrics sliced by user segments where one or more sub-population behaves significantly differently from the rest of the population

- Apply Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparison (check implementation details at the end)

- Concise Summarization of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Using Total Variation Regularized Regression

- Online Controlled Experiments: Introduction, Pitfalls, and Scaling(see pitfall 6: failing to look at segments)

### 111. How to Ingest Data Into Statsig

**Date:** 2024-07-16T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Logan Bates  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-ingest-data-into-statsig


**Summary:**  
During my endeavors as a data engineer, I’d spend hours helping teams translate data models and building data pipelines between software tools so they could effectively communicate. The frustration of getting the data into tools often spoiled the intended initial experience and added complexities to a production implementation. Event filters can be utilized to reduce downstream event volume to Statsig, so only your relevant metrics are analyzed.


**Key Points:**

- Access to your data source (e.g., data warehouse, 3rd party data tool/CDP, or application code).

- Necessary permissions to read from and write to your data source. (if applicable)

- Familiarity with SQL (if you're using a data warehouse)

- Use thelogEventmethod in various languages to quickly populate Statsig with data for experimentation and analysis

- Log additional metrics alongside 3rd party or internal logging systems to enhance measurement capabilities

- Use in situations where the SDKs are not supported or preferred

- Can be used to support custom metric ingestion workflows

- Quickly populate Statsig with metric data and analyze with themetrics explorer

### 112. Product experimentation best practices

**Date:** 2024-07-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-experimentation-best-practices


**Summary:**  
A good design document eliminates much of the ambiguity and uncertainty often encountered in the analysis and decision-making stages. Example: For example:
- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
### Power analysis, allocation, and duration
Allocation
This is the percentage of the user base that will be eligible for this experiment. These often include:
- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Se


**Key Points:**

- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)

- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)

- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric

- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs

- Running concurrent, mutually exclusive experiments requires allocating a fraction of the user base to each experiment.  On Statsig this is handled withLayers.

- A smaller allocation may be preferable for high-risk experiments, especially when the overall user base is large enough.

- For guardrail metrics: The MDE should be the largest regression size you’re willing to miss and ship unknowingly.

- Use power analysis to determine the duration needed to reach the MDE for each the those primary metrics. If they yield different results, pick the longest one.

### 115. An overview of making early decisions on experiments 

**Date:** 2024-07-05T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Mike London   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/making-early-decisions-on-experiments


**Summary:**  
Online experimentation is becoming more commonplace across all types of businesses today. #### Rewards:
- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.


**Key Points:**

- Noisy data:Early data can be noisy and may not represent the true effect of the experiment, leading to incorrect conclusions (higher likelihood of false positives/false negatives).

- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.

- Resource allocation:Identifying a strong positive or negative trend can help decide whether to continue investing resources in the experiment.

- Select a population: Choose the appropriate population for your experiment. This could be based on a past experiment, a qualifying event, or the entire user base.

- Choose metrics: Input the metrics you plan to use as your evaluation criteria. You can add multiple metrics to analyze sensitivity in your target population.

- Run the power analysis: Provide the above inputs to the tool. Statsig will simulate an experiment, calculating population sizes and variance based on historical behavior.

- Review the readout: Examine the week-by-week simulation results. This will show estimates of the number of users eligible for the experiment each day, derived from historical data.

- It can shrink confidence intervals and p-values, which means that statistically significant results can be achieved with a smaller sample size.

### 116. Understanding significance levels: A key to accurate data analysis

**Date:** 2024-07-03  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-significance-levels-a-key-to-accurate-data-analysis


**Summary:**  
In this post, we provide an introduction to significance levels, what they are, and why they are important for data analysis. Example: For example, let's say you're comparing two versions of a feature using an A/B test. A lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) reduces the risk offalse positivesbut increases the risk of false negatives.


**Key Points:**

- P-values don't measure the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false.

- A statistically significant result doesn't necessarily imply practical significance or importance.

- The significance level (α) is not the probability of making a Type I error (false positive).

- In fields like medicine or aviation, where false positives can have severe consequences, a lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) may be more appropriate.

- For exploratory studies or when false negatives are more problematic, a higher significance level (e.g., 0.10) might be justified.

- P-values don't provide information about themagnitude or practical importanceof an effect.

- Focusing exclusively on p-values can lead to thefile drawer problem, where non-significant results are less likely to be published, creating a biased literature.

- P-values are influenced by sample size; large samples can yield statistically significant results for small, practically unimportant effects.

### 120. Statsig&#39;s Autotune adds contextual bandits for personalization

**Date:** 2024-06-26T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-autotune-contextual-bandits-personalization


**Summary:**  
These contextual bandits are a lightweight form of reinforcement learning that gives teams an easy way to personalize user experiences. Example: For example, a contextual bandit is a great choice to personalize if a user should see “Sports”, “Science”, or “Celebrities” as their top video unit; but it won’t be a good fit for determining which video (with new candidates every day, and with potentially tens of thousands of options) to show them. Running a few tests with Autotune AI can quickly give signal on how much there is to gain from personalizing product surfaces - potentially justifying investing in a dedicated team
## Start measuring your personalization
Hundreds of customers already use Statsig to measure improvements to theirpersonalization program.


**Key Points:**

- Don’t yet have the bandwidth to solve these problems, but want a placeholder for personalization as their teams get more mission-critical parts of their product built

- We’re excited to announce that Statsig’s multi-armed bandit platform (Autotune)now includes contextual bandits.

- When to use contextual bandits

- Hit the perfect note with Autotuned experiments

One of the competitive advantages we think Statsig has is “clock speed” - we just build faster than other teams building the same thing.


**Key Points:**

- Willingness - and internal/external alignment - to ship things that were functional-but-ugly

- Letting the development team play to their strengths

- Treating early customers like team members

- An Engineering “Code Machine” - someone who could crank out quality code twice as fast as other engineers

- A PM “Tech Lead” - someone who leads efforts across the company

- A DS “Product Hybrid” - someone who bridges product and engineering to solve complex business problems

- A year ago, Statsig announced Warehouse Native, bringing our experimentation platform into customers’ Data Warehouses.

### 129. How to debug your experiments and feature rollouts

**Date:** 2024-05-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-debug-your-experiments-and-feature-rollouts


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a product manager, or a software engineer, you know that even the most meticulously planned test rollout can encounter unexpected hiccups. Example: Statsig also allows you to override specific users, for example, if you wanted to test your feature with employees first in production. Statsig also offersstratified sampling; When experimenting on a user base where a tail-end of power users drive a large portion of an overall metric value, stratified sampling meaningfully reduces false positive rates and makes your results more consistent and trustworthy.


**Key Points:**

- Inadequate sampling: A sample that's too small or not representative of an evenly weighted distribution can lead to inconclusive or misleading results.

- Lack of confidence in metrics: Without trustworthy success metrics, it's harder to determine how to make a decision.

- User exposure issues: If users aren't exposed to the experiment as intended, your data won't reflect their true behavior.

- Biased experiments: Running multiple experiments that affect the same variables can contaminate your results.

- Technical errors: Bugs in the code can introduce unexpected variables that impact the experiment's outcome.

- Success criteria: Before launching an experiment, it's crucial to define how you’re measuring success. Make these metrics readily available for analysis.

- Running experiments mutually exclusively: To prevent experiments from influencing each other, consider using feature flagging frameworks.

- When it comes to digital experimentation and feature rollouts, the devil is often in the details.

### 131. How to track your features&#39; retention

**Date:** 2024-05-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-track-your-features-retention


**Summary:**  
The most common use of retention metrics that you’re familiar with, when A and B are the same action over different time periods T0 and T1, is just a special case of this more generalized definition. Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage. For example, day-of-week seasonality can be aggregated away by setting T0 and T1 to be 7 days in duration and measuring retention on a weekly cadence.


**Key Points:**

- Choosing appropriate A, B, T0, and T1

- The specificity vs sample size trade-off (choosing A)

- When repeated feature usage is more/less meaningful (choosing B)

- Evaluating useful time ranges (choosing T0, T1, and how many retention data points to generate)

- Using Metrics Explorer on Statsig to track feature retention

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage.

- For example, day-of-week seasonality can be aggregated away by setting T0 and T1 to be 7 days in duration and measuring retention on a weekly cadence.

### 148. The role of confidence levels in statistical analysis

**Date:** 2024-04-04T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/confidence-levels-in-statistical-analysis


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a business analyst, or just someone interested in understanding the nuances of statistical inference, grasping the concept of confidence levels is crucial. Example: For example, a 95% confidence level suggests that if we were to conduct the same study 100 times, we would expect the true parameter to fall within our calculated confidence interval in 95 out of those 100 times.


**Key Points:**

- The sample statistic (e.g., the sample mean)

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/intro-triangle-charts-retention


**Summary:**  
Triangle charts, also known as retention tables, are a powerful tool for understanding user behavior over time. This is crucial for identifying whether new features, updates, or changes in strategy are improving user engagement.


**Key Points:**

- Vertical analysis:Looking down a column allows you to compare the retention rates of different cohorts at the same lifecycle stage.

- Horizontal analysis:Reading across a row shows how a single cohort's retention evolves over time.

- Identifying patterns:They help in spotting patterns such as specific times when users tend to drop off or when they are most engaged.

- Product development:Understanding retention can guide product development by highlighting areas that need improvement to keep users coming back.

- When exploring the world of data visualization, you'll encounter various chart types, each with unique strengths.

### 153. The distinction between experiments and feature flags

**Date:** 2024-03-29T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/distinction-between-experiments-and-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
Feature flagsact as the straightforward gatekeepers of deployment, offering a choice—on or off—for introducing new features. As the quick experiment tool evolved, and its experimental rigor increased which ultimately caused us to lose our ability to create simple A/B tests like Gatekeeper originally allowed.


**Key Points:**

- Feature flags and experiments are indispensable tools in the software-building toolkit—but for different reasons.

- Feature flags, for shipping decisively

- Experiments, for seeking understanding

- The distinction between the two

- The benefits of a unified platform

- Centralized analysis and control

- Data consistency and real-time diagnostics

### 154. How to monitor the long term effects of your experiment

**Date:** 2024-03-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-monitor-the-long-term-effects-of-your-experiment


**Summary:**  
Now, imagine discovering six months later that it actually reduced long-term retention. Example: Let's get practical with an example from Statsig.


**Key Points:**

- User behavior is unpredictable: Users might initially react positively to a new feature but lose interest over time.

- External factors: Events outside your control, such as a global pandemic, can drastically alter user engagement and skew your experiment results.

- You then model these early signals against historical data of known long-term outcomes. This helps predict the eventual impact on retention.

- It's important to choose surrogate indexes wisely. They must have a proven correlation with the long-term outcome you care about.

- Engaged user biasmeans you're mostly hearing from your power users. They're not your average customer, so their feedback might lead you down a narrow path.

- Selective sampling issuesoccur when you only look at a subset of users. This might make you miss out on broader trends.

- Diversify your data sources: Don't rely solely on one type of user feedback. Look at a mix of both highly engaged users and those less active.

- Use stratified sampling: This means you'll divide your user base into smaller groups or strata based on characteristics like usage frequency. Then, sample evenly from these groups.

### 171. Understanding the role of the 95% confidence interval

**Date:** 2022-08-04T16:31:57.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/95-percent-confidence-interval


**Summary:**  
Yet its validity and usefulness is often questioned. Example: For example, startup companies that have a high risk tolerance will want to minimize false negatives by selecting lower confidence intervals (e.g., 80% or 90%). I’m a proponent of 95%confidence intervalsand recommend them as a solid default.


**Key Points:**

- A range of plausible values

- An indicator of how repeatable/stable our experimental method is

- It’s a reasonable low bar.In practice, it’s an achievable benchmark for most fields of research to remain productive.

- It’s ubiquitous.It ensures we’re all speaking the same language. What one team within your company considers significant is the same as another team.

- Set your confidence threshold BEFORE any data is collected. Cheaters change the confidence interval after there’s an opportunity to peek.

- Gelman, Andrew (Nov. 5, 2016).“Why I prefer 50% rather than 95% intervals”.

### 173. CUPED on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-07-07T21:55:42.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics. Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).


**Key Points:**

- The more stable a metric tends to be for the same user over time, the more CUPED can reduce variance and pre-experiment bias

- CUPED utilizespre-exposuredata for users, so experiments on new users or newly logged metrics won’t be able to leverage this technique

- Getting in the habit of setting up key metrics and starting to track metrics before an experiment starts will help you to get the most out of CUPED on Statsig

- Run experiments with more speed and accuracy

- How this will help you

- Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).

- Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics.

### 175. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Example: For example, if you typed “#m lgtm” the bot would respond with the macro lgtm, an image of a doge saying looks good to me. A few main reasons:
- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.


**Key Points:**

- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Within the Admin Panel -> Select Integrations -> Click Create custom integration

- Within Permissions, check “Group chat bot”, “Message any member”, and “Read all messages”

- You should get back a url that looks like this:http://71c8-216-207-142-218.ngrok.io. Input that as the callback url in the page webhook.

- Open uphttp://localhost:4040/in your browser. Here is where you can see requests sent and received by your webhook.

- Create a new Workplace group chat with your favorite coworkers and your bot, and trigger your bot by calling one of your macros such as “#m lgtm”

- Usehttp://localhost:4040/and console to debug as needed

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/early-startup-journey-my-first-year-at-statsig


**Summary:**  
A year ago on May 19th, 2021, I took a big leap of faith and departed my satisfying job at Facebook to join an early stage startup calledStatsig. To me, awell-defined design system is an essential building block(foundation)that will help us move and innovate faster.Without the Design System in place, it is difficult to maintain consistency while building quickly.


**Key Points:**

- Designing ourStatsig company websiteand visual assets

- Contributing to theStatsig documentations page

- Making various marketing assets (blog/video banner image, voice of customer series, press release assets etc)

- Managing our social media channel (primarily LinkedIn)

- Branding (swags, business cards, conference pamphlets, posters etc)

- Celebrating my first Statsig-versary with a blog post full of memories.

- The full journey

- Why I decided to join

### 177. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
They’re trying several ideas at any given time. If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.


**Key Points:**

- Have a clear set of questions the holdout is designed to answer. This will guide your design, holdout duration, value you get and will dictate what costs make sense to incur.

- Understand the costs associated with holdouts. Make sure teams that will pay those costs understand holdout goals and buy in.

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Feature Level Holdouts

- Measuring Cumulative Impact

- If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.

### 178. There’s More To Learn From Tests

**Date:** 2022-04-20T18:45:44.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts!) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way. Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.


**Key Points:**

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

- The target population is split randomly for a test, where some get the solution (Test) and some don’t (Control)

- Unrealized Value: Testing to Understand

- Don’t Waste Your Tests: Take Time to Think About The Results

- Parting Thoughts

- Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.

### 180. Modernizing the Customer Data Stack

**Date:** 2022-04-18T21:30:15.000Z  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/modernizing-the-customer-data-stack


**Summary:**  
There are two key factors influencing this rapid modernization:
- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.


**Key Points:**

- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.

- Businesses want to leverage rapidly evolving and automated data intelligence inside their customer-facing applications.

- Websites, mobile applications and server side applications.

- If a business is generating calculated metrics, model outputs or cohorts in a warehouse, that ultimately becomes a data producer as well.

- Help desks, payment systems, marketing tools, A/B testing tools, ad platforms, CRMs, etc.

- Too many custom pipelines, SDKs and transformations decrease the fidelity and manageability of data over time.

- It’s impossible to enforce schema standardization across channels without introducing latency (Everyone loves a bolt onMDM… right?).

- It’s impossible to resolve user identities across channels without complex user identity services, which introduce latency.

**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/we-fooled-ourselves-first


**Summary:**  
While the sales team wrangled everyone around a Magic 8 Ball, Vijaye Raji (Founder & CEO) had his own April 1st surprise gated on the company’s website and he used Statsig’s own Feature Gates to test it out. Example: A common example (that Statsig’s website uses as well) isGDPRcookie consent for countries in the EU.


**Key Points:**

- Dogfooding new features to your company using Feature Gates

- Example: A common example (that Statsig’s website uses as well) isGDPRcookie consent for countries in the EU.

### 182. Democratizing Experimentation

**Date:** 2022-03-21T05:41:41.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/democratizing-experimentation


**Summary:**  
When building out instant games on Facebook a few years back, a new developer switched to use a newer version of an internal SDK. Example: (once measures turn into goals, it’s possible to incent behavior that’s undesirable unless we’re prudent; see theHanoi Rat Problemfor an interesting example)
Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want? A more experienced teammate noticed the change reduced time spent in the game.


**Key Points:**

- Is the metric movement explainable?

- Are all significant movements being reported, not just the positive ones?

- Are guardrail metrics being violated?

- Is there a quota we’re drawing from?

- Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want?

- Guarding againstp-hacking (or selective reporting)(often by establishing guidelines like using ~14 day windows to report results over;see more about reading results safely here.)

- Amazon famously reduced distractions during checkout flows to improve conversion. This is a pattern that most ecommerce sites now optimize for.

- Experiment Review Best Practices

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/failing-fast-kiss-a-lot-of-frogs


**Summary:**  
In a startup, everybody builds stuff (code, websites, sales lists, etc) — and part of the building process is accepting that not everything you make is good.


**Key Points:**

- Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast.

**Date:** 2022-01-21T19:40:18.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/definitive-guide-ecommerce-growth


**Summary:**  
I’ve done it thrice, first with Flipkart, then with a company that I founded myself, then at Amazon. Example: For example, anA/B testfor checkout on the Vancouver Olympic Store showed that a single page checkout performed 21.8% better than the multi-step checkout. Large improvements deeper in the funnel require a smaller sample size to test and make every upstream step more effective.


**Key Points:**

- E-commerce is hard.

- 1. Optimizing Conversion Rate

- Crushing the Gloom of Cart Abandonment

- Lighting-up Add-to-Cart Conversions

- 2. Growing Visitors

- Content is Central

- Double Down by Targeting

### 188. Environments on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-01-07T02:06:10.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/environments-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments. Example: The solution for this is to create rules explicitly for the Dev and Staging environments (like in the global config example above). It optimizes for engineering efficiency : reducing errors and making troubleshooting faster.


**Key Points:**

- Two philosophies : Per Environment Config vs Global Config

- Wrinkles (and mitigation)

- Example: The solution for this is to create rules explicitly for the Dev and Staging environments (like in the global config example above).

- It optimizes for engineering efficiency : reducing errors and making troubleshooting faster.

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. Example: Try plugging your pitch into this template:
“[company]helps customers[verb] [business outcome]by[tech capability].”
For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”
### 2. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel.


**Key Points:**

- Sales is all about process.

- 1. Nail your pitch

- 2. Don’t reinvent the wheel

- 3. Warm up your leads

- 4. Be effective, not busy

- Example: Try plugging your pitch into this template:

### 192. Embrace Overlapping A/B Tests and Avoid the Dangers of Isolating Experiments

**Date:** 2021-10-08T06:44:42.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/embracing-overlapping-a-b-tests-and-the-danger-of-isolating-experiments


**Summary:**  
How to handle simultaneous experiments frequently comes up. Example: For example, one cannot test new ranking algorithm A (vs control) and also new ranking algorithm B (vs control) in overlapping tests. This method maintains experimental power, but can reduce accuracy (as I’ll explain later, this is not a major drawback).


**Key Points:**

- Isolated tests— Users are split into segments, and each user is enrolled in only one experiment. Your experimental power is reduced, but accuracy of results are maintained.

- Microsoft’s Online Controlled Experiments At Scale

- How Google Conducts More experiments

- Can You Run Multiple AB Tests At The Same Time?

- Large Scale Experimentation at Spotify

- Running Multiple A/B Tests at The Same Time: Do’s and Dont’s

- AtStatsig, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting many experimentalists from different backgrounds and experiences.

- Managing Multiple Experiments

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ab-testing-for-dummies


**Summary:**  
Since then, my level of understanding has graduated from preschool to elementary- nice! Example: Let me give you an example- for awhile, Facebook was testing out pimple popping videos to engage more folks on video. A/B testing means we can try out more features and quickly see which ones work.Instead of just holding onto one idea and running with it for 6 months, by progressively rolling out new ideas all the time, companies build better products faster.


**Key Points:**

- This is what I googled on my first day with Statsig.

- Example: Let me give you an example- for awhile, Facebook was testing out pimple popping videos to engage more folks on video.

**Key Points:**

- Mind over data at Netflix

- Mind over data📈

- Pursuit of True North 🧭

- ‘Criminally underused in tech’🚨

- Example: For example, LinkedIn aims to improve its hiring products with a true north metric calledconfirmed hires(CH), which measures members who found jobs using LinkedIn products.

### 196. Inside Look: Optimizing Conversion in E-commerce

**Date:** 2021-09-24T00:26:47.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-conversion-in-e-commerce


**Summary:**  
Today, I want to share an inside look into experimentation at a popular financial services company that offers payment processing services and APIs for e-commerce applications¹. Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience. This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.


**Key Points:**

- How experimentation moves the numbers in a popular payment processing company

- Experimentation is core to product development

- Experimentation with a smaller user base

- Choosing the right metrics

- All in on Experimentation

- Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience.

- This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-auth0-nailed-demand-generation


**Summary:**  
Similarly, reducing friction during evaluation means that we enable these leads to get qualified as efficiently as possible. Example: Let’s use a case study to see how a well-oiled demand generation engine works. #### Automating Demand Generation in Three Steps
Product-led Growth (PLG) is magical because it does two things really well:
- It reduces the cost of acquiring leads
It reduces the cost of acquiring leads
- It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product
It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product
Reducing the cost of acquiring leads means that we make lead generation as automated and efficient as possible.


**Key Points:**

- It reduces the cost of acquiring leads

- It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product

- Automating Demand Generation in Three Steps

- How an enterprise company found Auth0

- Auth0’s Demand Generation Engine

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift.


**Key Points:**

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

- It is less susceptible to external shocks (holidays, marketing pulses).

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- Use proxies, not your KPIs

- Boost signal and reduce noise with thoughtful statistics

- Covariate adjustment (CUPED & CURE)

**Date:** 2025-06-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. Example: Example: It has become common for chat interface-based apps (like ChatGPT, Vercel V0, Lovable) to experiment with suggested prompts to help users quickly discover and realize value, which subsequently drives engagement and retention.


**Key Points:**

- Good logging on all the product metrics you care about

- The ability to link these metrics to everything you release

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

- Trend 2: More AI code drives the need for quantitative optimization

- Trend 3: Every engineer is a growth engineer

- Trend 4: Product value comes from your unique context

- Closing thoughts: AI is part of every product

**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. Paradoxically,trying to control everything actually reduces your control over what matters most.


**Key Points:**

- Defining outcomes that matter rather than dictating every task

- Providing context about user needs and business priorities

- Creating frameworks that enable autonomous decision-making

- Trusting your engineers to determine the "how" once they understand the "why"

- The challenge of proving value

- The two paths for product leaders

- The brute force PM

- The force-multiplier leader

### 5. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. Example: For example, let’s say you true north metric is the revenue generated in the next year. Over time, product changes can improve or degrade the quality of prediction that a particular surrogate model produces.


**Key Points:**

- Inputs should be independent of assignment. Assignment to any given experiment group should be random and not correlated to any input to the predictive model.

- Outputs should not exhibit heteroscedasticity. For each predicted value, the prediction and the expected magnitude of the error term should not be correlated.

- Best Practice for ML Engineering

- 6 Best Practices for Machine Learning

- Machine Learning Model Evaluation

- Online Experimentation with Surrogate Metrics: Guidelines and a Case Study

From the slow burn of AI adoption to the messy realities of product growth, the conversation was rich with honest takes, timeless lessons, and the kind of hard-won wisdom you only get from people who’ve shipped at scale.


**Key Points:**

- Ami Vora, former CPO of Faire and VP of Product at WhatsApp and Facebook Ads

- Rajeev Rajan, CTO at Atlassian and former VP of Engineering at Facebook and Microsoft

- Howie Xu, Chief AI & Innovation Officer at Gen, founder of VMware’s networking division, and AI-focused investor and lecturer at Stanford

- Ami: At WhatsApp, the focus was on reliability and making the product feel like a utility or physical object. Fewer tests, fewer changes, and a relentless commitment to stability.

- Rajeev: Atlassian steers clear of sweeping UI overhauls in Jira. “It’s like redesigning a car dashboard—you can’t mess with muscle memory.”

- Ami: “Stay on the frontier of learning. It never feels good to be bad at something—but that’s where the learning starts.”

- Rajeev: “Forget the next title. Write the book of your life—what story do you want to tell?”

- Howie: “The new skill is TQ—token quotient. The more you engage with AI tools, the more prepared you’ll be.”

### 7. The rise of experimentation as the industry standard

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. Example: One notable example is the16-month TV advertising experimentAmazon ran in a few markets, which showed that TV ads delivered only a modest sales bump. In the new model we grow bylearning faster—hundreds of tiny, controlled bets that compound.


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- Experimenting with the length of forms to mitigate user dropoffs

- Using 20% of an email audience to suss out the best email subject line and sending it to the remaining 80%

- Testingvirtually anythingin a focus group

- Implementing customer surveys to gauge reactions to potential upcoming initiatives

- Jeff Bezos on the importance of experimentation

- A booming market for experimentation platforms like Statsig

- Examples of high-impact experiments

### 8. Digital marketing attribution models: A tech survey

**Date:** 2025-04-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. Example: Early versions were still rule-based (for example, splitting credit evenly or favoring the first and last touches). MMM emerged in the 1950s (though it rose to popularity in the 1980s) as a top-down approach that uses aggregate data and statistical regression to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel to sales [1].


**Key Points:**

- Shapley Value Attribution

- Algorithmic/Statistical Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ML)

- Incrementality Testing and Lift Models

- Causal Inference-Based Multi-Channel Attribution

- Customer Journey-based Deep Learning Models

- Captures sequential nature of journeys.

- Explains results via the “If we remove channel X, how many conversions are lost?” logic, which is intuitive.

- More nuanced than any single-position rule; channels that primarily appear in converting paths get more credit.

### 10. Introducing CURE: Smarter regression, faster experiments

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/announcing-cure


**Summary:**  
Statsig is excited to announce that we’re moving out of beta testing and into full production launch for CURE - an extension of CUPED - which allows users to add arbitrary covariate data to regression adjustment in their experiments, reducing variance even further than existing CUPED implementations. Example: For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results. For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED: Controlled [Experiment] Using Pre-Experiment Data

- CURE: [Variance] Control Using Regression Estimates

- If you have a predictive model of future behaviors, you can easilyuse that as a covariate in CURE(like Doordash’s CUPAC)

- If you want to provide additional signal to the standard CUPAC approach, you canpick and choose different user attributes or behaviorsto add to the regression

- CURE brings powerful, flexible regression adjustment to every Statsig experiment.

### 13. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. Example: For example, a treatment’s impact on revenue might be most noticeable among high-spending players, where behavioral changes are more pronounced. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects.


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type II error (β):The probability of failing to detect a true improvement when one exists.

- Set the winsorization threshold (X%):In A/B testing, common choices are 1% or 0.1%, depending on the required adjustment and sample size.

- Replace extreme values:Values beyond these thresholds are capped at the corresponding percentile values.

- Why outliers can be harmful

- How to identify outliers

- What to do with outliers

- Time for winsorization!

### 14. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. - Tightening the Confidence (Credible) Interval:Alternatively, one can choose a narrower prior that reduces uncertainty in the posterior distribution.


**Key Points:**

- The choice of priors can strongly influence the resulting posterior estimates, requiring careful calibration to avoid unintentionally skewing the analysis.

- Neither type of informed Bayesian approach is “wrong” in principle, but the first introduces a greater risk of data manipulation, while the second can slow down decision-making.

- In many cases, the second approach is effectively equivalent to applying FDR-type frequentist adjustments and often yields the same outcomes, just framed in Bayesian terms.

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

- 1. Introduction

- 2. Literature review

- 2.1 Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches in A/B tests

### 15. Why buying an experimentation platform makes more sense than building one

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/buying-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
“Building your own experimentation platform made a lot of sense… five years ago,” says our customer Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager - Core ML at Whatnot, who previously worked on DoorDash’s in-house platform. Example: For example, over the past year we’ve shipped several advanced capabilities that you won’t find in a typical experimentation platform:
- Stats methodologies such as stratified sampling, differential impact detection, interaction detection, Benjamini Hochberg procedure etc. Over the past few years, several companies have moved away from in-house experimentation tooling and turned to Statsig to scale their experimentation cultures.Notionincreased their experimentation velocity by 30x within a year.Limewent from limited testing to experimenting on every change before rolling it out.


**Key Points:**

- Server & client-side SDKsfor seamless experimentation across all surfaces without impacting performance

- Data logging, ingestion and processing servicesand/or integration with your data warehouse

- Randomization functionsfor accurate user allocations in different scenarios

- Experiment result computationsincluding metric lifts, p-values, confidence intervals, and other statistical calculations

- Automated checks(like power analysis, balanced exposures) to ensure experiments are properly set up and issues are identified proactively

- Statistical correctionsto account for outliers, pre-experimental bias, and differential impact, etc. to provide trustworthy results

- Variance reduction(CUPED, winsorization)

- Experimentation techniqueslike sequential testing, switchback testing, geo-based tests etc.

### 17. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Vercel Native Integration

**Date:** 2025-02-27T07:00-12:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-vercel-native-integration


**Summary:**  
Modern web development depends on a seamless experience for users and developers. Performant, fast, and reliable websites are table stakes for users in 2025.At the same time, websites and applications are becoming increasingly complex, with more features, integrations, and components contributing to the user experience. Example: For example, if you're introducing a new navigation layout, you can first enable the flag for internal users, gather feedback, and then gradually roll it out to production—all without pushing a new deployment. No developer wants to manage extra configurations, third-party dashboards, or custom integrations, and no user wants to see a page flicker on load, or experience another 100ms wait until the page renders.


**Key Points:**

- Create and manage feature flagsto control your releases

- Run experimentsto test changes and measure impact

- Gain access to Analytics, Session Replay, and other Statsig product toolsthat don’t exist natively in your Vercel dashboard

- Use Statsig’s SDKs and Edge Config syncingfor low-latency performance without additional setup

- Install the integration:Find Statsig in the Vercel Marketplace and complete the quick setup flow

- Choose a billing plan:Both plans offer generous limits: theFree tierincludes 2M events/month, while thePro tierprovides 5M events/month for just $150

- Install Statsig and connect your Statsig project: Link your Statsig project to Vercel to sync feature flags, experiments, settings, permissions, etc.

- Initialize with Vercel’s Flags SDK or Statsig's SDK:We recommend using Vercel's Flags SDK for Next.js and SvelteKit projects; use Statsig’s SDK for all other projects

### 20. The ultimate guide to building an internal feature flagging system

**Date:** 2025-01-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
“Why do people pay for this?”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions. Example: You’re also likely to find some synergies in the code you write across these two services - for example, the service that provides evaluated flag values to clients can borrow logic from the code that evaluates rulesets on your servers, provided they’re written in the same language. - Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?


**Key Points:**

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

- Handle targeting on any user trait, like app version, country, IP address, etc.?

- Have extremely high uptime?

- test a feature in production (by “gating” it to only employees/ beta testers)

- rollout a feature to only certain geographies (by “gating” on user countries)

- run an A/B test (by gating a feature to a random 50% of userIDs)

- Or Run acanary release(release a feature to a random 10% of userIDs, to check that it doesn’t break anything)

### 21. Detecting interaction effects of concurrent experiments

**Date:** 2025-01-13T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Kane Luo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/interaction-effect-detection


**Summary:**  
To accelerate experimentation, medium to large companies run hundreds of A/B tests simultaneously, aiming to isolate and measure the impact of each change, also known as the "main effect."
However, when multiple tests target the same area of your product, they can influence one another, resulting in either overestimation or underestimation of metric changes. Example: For example, to understand the effect of dark mode without the transition animation, you would compare group C to group A using a standard two-sample t-test. This expands the UI compatibility and aims to improve retention.


**Key Points:**

- Relaunch the same experimentsto a mutually exclusive audience. This is especially useful if you need more statistical power particularly on secondary metrics.

- Conduct manual statistical testsand determine which one of the two features to ship.

- If the interaction is synergistic, you candouble down on the combined experience, by either launching a new test or analyzing group A and D.

- Rework the experienceto make the feature compatible.

- Statsig now offersinteraction effect detectionto uncover the hidden effects of experiments on each other.

- Scenario: Dark mode gone wrong

- How do we diagnose it?

- My experiments are interacting—now what?

### 23. You don&#39;t need large sample sizes to run A/B tests

**Date:** 2024-12-12T03:15+00:00  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/you-dont-need-large-sample-sizes-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Yet many small and medium-sized companies aren’t running A/B Tests. Example: Google routinely runs large search tests on a massive scale, for example 100,000,000 users where a+0.1% effect on topline metrics is a big win. A/B testing is a pillar of data-driven product development irrespective of the product’s size
### Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing
Startup companies have a major advantage in experimentation:huge potential and upside.Startups don’t play the micro-optimization game; they don’t care about a +0.2% increase in click-through rates.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED(Controlled Experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) leverages historical metrics to reduce noise and refine your estimates.

- Stratified Samplingensures balanced and reliable comparisons across small, skewed user segments.

- Differential Impactcan reveal directional and qualitative findings, providing a little more color to the results of your experiment.

- Small companies’ secret advantage in experimentation

- Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing

- Bayesian A/B test calculator

- Google vs a startup: Who has more statistical power?

- Big effects are seldom obvious

**Date:** 2024-10-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-rollouts-examples


**Summary:**  
Instagram was becoming the primary medium for keeping tabs on friends and influencers alike—perceiving the world through their iPhone lenses, in a way. Example: Take Spotify Wrapped, for example. I’m not sure if it was always meant to be a temporary feature, or if it simply didn’t increase the metrics that Meta had hoped.


**Key Points:**

- Just got fired from my job:Thankful🌸

- Looking for carpenter recommendations:Thankful🌸

- A compilation of Mark Zuckerberg talking about barbecue sauce:Thankful🌸

- This thankful react thing needs to stop:Thankful🌸

- Tag Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post

- Sign up for my random newsletter

- Feature flags: Toggle switches for system behavior/features in production that allow for gradual rollouts, A/B testing, kill switches, etc.

- Holdouts: Used to measure the cumulative impact of feature releases and check if wins are sustained over time.

### 28. How A/B testing platforms make data science more interesting

**Date:** 2024-10-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-ab-testing-platforms-make-data-science-more-interesting


**Summary:**  
A/B testing platforms have become highly efficient, automating much of the mundane work involved in setting up, calculating, and reporting on experiments. Example: "An engineer that improves server performance by ten milliseconds more than pays for his or her fully loaded annual costs."
Illustrating the tangible impact of small improvements, Kohavi shared this powerful example. ## Excerpts
"Most experiments fail to improve the metrics they were designed to improve."
Kohavi highlighted a counterintuitive reality: the majority of experiments don't yield the expected positive results.


**Key Points:**

- What’s the current state of experimentation automation since the release of the Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (the "Hippo" book)?

- How does this automation impact the role of data scientists?

- What should data scientists focus on moving forward?

- How can we secure leadership buy-in for experimentation efforts?

- Over the past few years, the data science landscape has fundamentally changed.

- My questions to Ronny:

- Three takeaways

- Experimentation automation benefits data scientists both directly and indirectly

### 34. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Example: Funnels allow you to measure complex relationships with a higher degree of clarity.For example, you see revenue flatten, but product page views are going up. If you care about improving your checkout flow for products, tracking this data at a session level is more powerful, measuring (successes / tries) instead of (successful users / users who tried)
Consider when a user vs.


**Key Points:**

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- Statistical rigor:Make sure funnel conversions have the delta method applied and have sound practices for ordinal logic.

- Ordered events:For funnels to be really useful, you should be able to specify that users do events in a specific sequence over time.

- Multiple-step funnels:Two-step funnels can be useful, but the ability to add intermediate steps as needed for richer understanding is critical.

- Step-level and overall conversion changes:This is how you can identifywheredrop-offs happen.

- Calculation windows:Being able to specify the maximum duration a user has to finish a funnel is critical to running longer experiments.

**Date:** 2024-09-15T00:00-05:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped


**Summary:**  
MeaningControlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data, CUPED is frequently cited as—and used as—one of the most powerful algorithmic tools for increasing the speed and accuracy of experimentation programs. Example: In the example below, it’s pretty obvious that the difference in the groupsbeforethe test would make the results extremely skewed:
You might note that you can see that the weighted runners’ times went up, and the unweighted runners’ times went down. In this article, we’ll:
- Cover the background of CUPED
Cover the background of CUPED
- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
## What CUPED solves:
As an experiment matures and hits its target date for readout, it’s not uncommon to see a result that seems to beonly barelyoutside the range where it would be treated as statistical


**Key Points:**

- Cover the background of CUPED

- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED

- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments

- The effect size in our T-test (the delta between test and control) is exactly the same as the “test” variable’s coefficient in the OLS regression.

- The standard error for the coefficient is the same as the standard error for our T-test.

- The p-value for the “test” variable coefficient is the same as for our t-test!

- Our p-value goes from 0.116 to 0.000 because of the decreased Standard Error. The result, which was previously not statistically significant, is now clearly significant.

- Multiply the pre-experiment population mean byθand add it to each user’s result

### 53. The distinction between experiments and feature flags

**Date:** 2024-03-29T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/distinction-between-experiments-and-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
Feature flagsact as the straightforward gatekeepers of deployment, offering a choice—on or off—for introducing new features. As the quick experiment tool evolved, and its experimental rigor increased which ultimately caused us to lose our ability to create simple A/B tests like Gatekeeper originally allowed.


**Key Points:**

- Feature flags and experiments are indispensable tools in the software-building toolkit—but for different reasons.

- Feature flags, for shipping decisively

- Experiments, for seeking understanding

- The distinction between the two

- The benefits of a unified platform

- Centralized analysis and control

- Data consistency and real-time diagnostics

### 54. How to monitor the long term effects of your experiment

**Date:** 2024-03-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-monitor-the-long-term-effects-of-your-experiment


**Summary:**  
Now, imagine discovering six months later that it actually reduced long-term retention. Example: Let's get practical with an example from Statsig.


**Key Points:**

- User behavior is unpredictable: Users might initially react positively to a new feature but lose interest over time.

- External factors: Events outside your control, such as a global pandemic, can drastically alter user engagement and skew your experiment results.

- You then model these early signals against historical data of known long-term outcomes. This helps predict the eventual impact on retention.

- It's important to choose surrogate indexes wisely. They must have a proven correlation with the long-term outcome you care about.

- Engaged user biasmeans you're mostly hearing from your power users. They're not your average customer, so their feedback might lead you down a narrow path.

- Selective sampling issuesoccur when you only look at a subset of users. This might make you miss out on broader trends.

- Diversify your data sources: Don't rely solely on one type of user feedback. Look at a mix of both highly engaged users and those less active.

- Use stratified sampling: This means you'll divide your user base into smaller groups or strata based on characteristics like usage frequency. Then, sample evenly from these groups.

### 55. Demystifying identity resolution

**Date:** 2024-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/demystifying-identity-resolution


**Summary:**  
The notion of “identity resolution” in the SaaS world continues to be an elusive gold standard that businesses want to solve in order to understand the full scope of customer behaviors across all touch-points. Example: ## Example ID resolution scenarios
Scenario 1:An unknown user visits the website and gets assigned to the “Test” group fornav_v2experiment using via a deviceID.


**Key Points:**

- No technology providers will solve every use-case and scenario perfectly, though many will make bold claims. There is a ton of nuance here and no one-size-fits-all solution.

- It is strictly impossible to reliably identify a single human interacting anonymously on two different devices that never identify themselves.

- Unknown user identity becomes the crux of the challenge. When switching devices, browsers, environments (server vs. client), or clearing device storage, this ID will not persist.

- The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds.

**Author:** Sid Kumar and Skye Scofield   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/evaluate-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
Vitamin products make you better over time, but they don’t solve an acute problem right away.For many companies, experimentation platforms can feel like a vitamin product. Example: For example, if you're migrating from LaunchDarkly, you can take advantage of Statsig'smigration toolthat lets you port your feature flags in under 5 minutes! Experimentation platforms also fix other acute pain points, including:
- Giving teams a single source of truth for key product & growth metrics

- Negative impact from deploying losing features (i.e., metric regressions that you didn't catch)

- Continue adding complexity to your existing processes

- Accumulate more technical debt

- Do you have granular control for flexible, precise targeting of users?

### 62. Online experimentation: The new paradigm for building AI applications

**Date:** 2023-04-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Palak Goel and Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-products-require-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:
First, product managers would come up with a new idea for a product and lay out a release timeline. Example: But the risks are palpable—for every AI success story, there’s an example of a biased model sharing misinformation, or a feature being pulled due to safety concerns. #### In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today.


**Key Points:**

- How can you launch and iterate on features quickly without compromising your existing user experience?

- How can you move fast while ensuring your apps are safe and reliable?

- How can you ensure that the features you launch lead to substantive, differentiated improvements in user outcomes?

- How can you identify the optimal prompts and models for your specific use case?

- Build compelling AI features that engage users

- Flight dozens of models, prompts and parameters in the ‘back end’ of these features

- Collect data on all inputs and outputs

- Use this data to select the best-performing variant and fine-tune new models

Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
- Keep things consistent: We’ll treat your imported data just the same as SDK data, materializing into experiment results, creating tracking datasets, and eventually allowing you to explore it in tools like Events Explorer.


**Key Points:**

- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started

- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig

- In your Statsig metrics page, you’ll be able to find the new “Ingestions” tab

- Here, you can give us connection information for one of the supported data warehouses

### 64. CUPED on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-07-07T21:55:42.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics. Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).


**Key Points:**

- The more stable a metric tends to be for the same user over time, the more CUPED can reduce variance and pre-experiment bias

- CUPED utilizespre-exposuredata for users, so experiments on new users or newly logged metrics won’t be able to leverage this technique

- Getting in the habit of setting up key metrics and starting to track metrics before an experiment starts will help you to get the most out of CUPED on Statsig

- Run experiments with more speed and accuracy

- How this will help you

- Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).

### 67. Modernizing the Customer Data Stack

**Date:** 2022-04-18T21:30:15.000Z  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/modernizing-the-customer-data-stack


**Summary:**  
There are two key factors influencing this rapid modernization:
- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.


**Key Points:**

- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.

- Businesses want to leverage rapidly evolving and automated data intelligence inside their customer-facing applications.

- Websites, mobile applications and server side applications.

- If a business is generating calculated metrics, model outputs or cohorts in a warehouse, that ultimately becomes a data producer as well.

- Help desks, payment systems, marketing tools, A/B testing tools, ad platforms, CRMs, etc.

- Too many custom pipelines, SDKs and transformations decrease the fidelity and manageability of data over time.

- It’s impossible to enforce schema standardization across channels without introducing latency (Everyone loves a bolt onMDM… right?).

- It’s impossible to resolve user identities across channels without complex user identity services, which introduce latency.

### 70. Embrace Overlapping A/B Tests and Avoid the Dangers of Isolating Experiments

**Date:** 2021-10-08T06:44:42.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/embracing-overlapping-a-b-tests-and-the-danger-of-isolating-experiments


**Summary:**  
How to handle simultaneous experiments frequently comes up. Example: For example, one cannot test new ranking algorithm A (vs control) and also new ranking algorithm B (vs control) in overlapping tests. This method maintains experimental power, but can reduce accuracy (as I’ll explain later, this is not a major drawback).


**Key Points:**

- Isolated tests— Users are split into segments, and each user is enrolled in only one experiment. Your experimental power is reduced, but accuracy of results are maintained.

- Microsoft’s Online Controlled Experiments At Scale

- How Google Conducts More experiments

- Can You Run Multiple AB Tests At The Same Time?

- Large Scale Experimentation at Spotify

- Running Multiple A/B Tests at The Same Time: Do’s and Dont’s

- AtStatsig, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting many experimentalists from different backgrounds and experiences.

- Managing Multiple Experiments

### 1. Profiling Server Core: How we cut memory usage by 85%

**Date:** 2025-10-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Daniel Loomb  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/profiling-server-core-how-we-cut-memory-usage


**Summary:**  
The goal was simple: optimize a single codebase and see the results across every server SDK. #### Server Core v0.2.0
When we first launched Server Core, we hadn't yet invested the time to improve memory.


**Key Points:**

- Our Legacy Statsig Python SDK at version 0.64.0

- Our Server Core Python SDK at version 0.2.0 (before memory optimizations)

- Our Server Core Python SDK at version 0.9.3 (latest optimizations)

- Strings consumed 56 MB.Repeated values like "idType": "userID" appeared thousands of times.

- Repeated values like "idType": "userID" appeared thousands of times.

- DynamicReturnable objects consumed 69 MB.They were often duplicated across experiments and layers.

- They were often duplicated across experiments and layers.

- Makes cloning cheap (critical for when the SDK logs exposures, where strings can be repeated frequently).

### 2. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong: Navigating multiple comparison corrections in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparison-corrections-in-a-b


**Summary:**  
This occurs when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted simultaneously, whether it’s peeking at the data during the experiment, examining several key performance indicators (KPIs), or analyzing different segments of the population. Example: For example, with an alpha of 5% and 5 tests, you would reject the null hypothesis for p-values lower than 0.01, instead of 0.05. Additionally, strict corrections like Bonferroni significantly reduce statistical power.


**Key Points:**

- Rank all p-values in ascending order.

- For each p-value, calculate 𝑖 / 𝑚 * 𝛼, where i is the rank of the p-value (according to step 1) and m is the total number of tests.

- Find the largest rank (k) for which the p-value is smaller than the value calculated in step 2.

- Reject all hypotheses till rank k.

- 1 control group, drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 12.

- 7 treatment groups, sampled from the same distribution as the control (i.e., no true effect).

- 3 treatment groups, each with a true revenue uplift of 2.5% (mean = 102.5).

- The proportion of significant results among the three treatment groups with true effects.

### 3. Experiments with AI in the Creative Process

**Date:** 2025-10-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cat Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experiments-with-ai-creative


**Summary:**  
In-house OOH campaigns are rare opportunities to exercise creativity beyond the usual brand tone. They can be tailored to their context - location, audience, event - and reframe a brand's core narrative. Example: (For example, uploading a picture of a pit stop wheel gun would generate something that looked like a hair dryer.)
Even after getting the generated image "close enough," the resolution was low, edges were messy, and details were off. Ultimately we found that using AI helped us increase ourcreative velocity: the speed at which our ideas could become real and move to execution.


**Key Points:**

- Quickly generate images to communicate concepts

- Create numerous copy variations to expand our brainstorms

- Research contextually relevant information

- Clarify your vision first—creative direction is keyThis is the pivotal point in the creative process where you either use AI creatively or let AI be creative for you.

- Use AI to optimize for AIOnce you've set a clear creative direction, refine your language to work with the specific image generation models you're using.

- Early Phase: Concept Development

- Mid Phase: Fleshing out a direction

- Key learnings for prompting

### 6. How we created count distinct in Statsig Cloud

**Date:** 2025-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Aamodit Acharya  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-we-created-count-distinct-in-statsig-cloud


**Summary:**  
When I joined Statsig, I spent my first week reading through customer requests. Almost immediately, a pattern jumped out to me. Unique artists in the first 7 days.


**Key Points:**

- Distinct artists listened per user

- Distinct SKUs purchased per user

- Distinct search queries issued per user

- Distinct repositories pushed per user

- Distinct merchants paid per user

- Wed: viewed {A}If you summed daily distincts you would get 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.Merging the three sketches yields {A, B, C}, which is 3.

- I kept the core model in Spark SQL and stored each day’s sketch as a base64 string in Parquet on GCS so it can safely move through BigQuery tables when needed.

- On the Spark side, I decode that field back into a native sketch and continue merges and extraction with the Spark UDFs and helpers.

### 7. Sink, swim, or scale: What startups teach us about launching AI

**Date:** 2025-08-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Alexey Komissarouk  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-startups-lessons-learned


**Summary:**  
About the guest author.Alexey Komissarouk is aGrowth Engineering Advisorwho teachesGrowth Engineering on Reforge. Previously, he was the Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Early users, however, complained they “still didn’t know what to do with this thing.”Notion pivotedfrom “AI writes for you” to “AI improves what you’ve already written,” redesigned starter prompts, and saw usage rise as the mental cost of exploration dropped.


**Key Points:**

- Pre‑negotiate burst capacity with vendors (spot GPUs, secondary clouds, reseller credits) so you scale up within minutes without surprise bills.

- Offer a “happy hour” off‑peak tier that absorbs hobby traffic without harming premium latency.

- Replace blank prompt boxes with role‑based starter chips and one‑click examples that autofill.

- Instrument “prompt redo” and “undo” events as frustration signals; run weekly funnel reviews on them.

- Offer an “explain my last prompt” toggle—turning trial‑and‑error into guided learning.

- When financially viable, start with a flat plan that eliminates mental transaction costs; layer in usage-based overages only once users reach actual ceilings.

- Expose “token burn so far” inside the interface, not tucked away in billing dashboards.

- Run price‑sensitivity experiments onengagedcohorts, not top‑of‑funnel sign‑ups; willingness to pay lags perceived mastery.

### 8. Optimizing cloud compute costs with GKE and compute classes

**Date:** 2025-07-25T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-cloud-compute-costs-with-gke-and-compute-classes


**Summary:**  
Anyone who has optimized cloud compute costs knows that spot nodes can significantly reduce your bill. Example: But we found that node weighting alone has significant limitations:
- Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling
Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling
- Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time
Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time
### Detailed real-world example
To showcase why this is problematic here is a detailed example. ### How do you reduce your cloud compute costs without using a third-party vendor?


**Key Points:**

- Loss of Control: You're entrusting third-party providers with your node management, which could risk disrupting your workflows with opaque algorithms

- Cost: These services can significantly add to your operational expenses

- Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling

- Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time

- Pool A: Cheapest spot nodes, high preemption rate (5% per hour)

- Pool B: Moderately priced spot nodes, lower preemption rate (2% per hour)

- Pool C: Non-spot nodes, most expensive, zero preemption

- Initial State: All workloads run on Pool A (100 nodes).

### 10. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. Example: Another great example is Notion AI, which writes and summarizes within your existing workspace. Keep response time below 200 ms and uptime above 99.9 %, and you’ve passed.


**Key Points:**

- Google's Geminioutperformed GPT-4 on 30 of 32 benchmarksand beat humans on language understanding tests. Once deployed, it suggestedadding glue to pizzato make cheese stick better.

- Perplexity faced lawsuitsforcreating fake news sectionsand falsely attributing content to real publications.

- Note: We recently launched our Evals product that solves this problem - clickhereto learn more

- Monitor success metrics.These metrics become your real quality benchmarks. The easiest way to do this is with product analytics.

- Watch user sessions.Record user interactions to understand the stories behind metrics - why users drop off, where confusion occurs, when they ignore AI suggestions.

### 11. The more the merrier? The problem of multiple comparisons in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-07-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results? Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

- How to deal with multiple comparisons

- Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.

### 12. Randomization: The ABC’s of A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-06-30T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it? Example: This example underscores the critical importance of random allocation. It may also be influenced by infrastructure constraints (e.g., if the company’s allocation system only supports online assignment) or performance considerations (e.g., offline assignment may reduce runtimes).


**Key Points:**

- (A) Simple Randomization:Randomly assign users into two groups without considering balancing factors.

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

- Simple randomization: just go with the flow

- Seed randomization: Take your best shot

- Stratified randomization: Be a control freak

- ‍Which randomization method should you use?

- 1. Which users are participating in the experiment?

### 13. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift.


**Key Points:**

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

- It is less susceptible to external shocks (holidays, marketing pulses).

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- Use proxies, not your KPIs

- Boost signal and reduce noise with thoughtful statistics

- Covariate adjustment (CUPED & CURE)


---


### 14. You can have it all: Parallel testing with A/B tests

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel. By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.


**Key Points:**

- Why test in parallel?

- What should you watch out for?

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel.

- By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.

**Author:** Israel Ben Baruch  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/move-forward-the-a-b-testing-mindset-guide


**Summary:**  
Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time. It sharpens your thinking and helps you act faster if your current test fails.


**Key Points:**

- Be obsessed.You check results more than you should. You run through your funnels again and again. Your head swarms with ideas. You’re not crazy, you’re exactly where you should be.

- Organizational culture.Your mindset needs an organization that supports it - one that encourages people to take risks, experiment, and always push forward.

- Professional expertise.CRO is a craft. Find the people, the content, and the companies to learn from. Apply. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. Most importantly: keep evolving.

- Great tools.Use high-quality, reliable measurement and testing platforms. They’re the foundation of effective testing. No compromises.

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

### 16. Experimentation and AI: 4 trends we’re seeing 

**Date:** 2025-06-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. Example: Example: It has become common for chat interface-based apps (like ChatGPT, Vercel V0, Lovable) to experiment with suggested prompts to help users quickly discover and realize value, which subsequently drives engagement and retention.


**Key Points:**

- Good logging on all the product metrics you care about

- The ability to link these metrics to everything you release

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

- Trend 2: More AI code drives the need for quantitative optimization

- Trend 3: Every engineer is a growth engineer

- Trend 4: Product value comes from your unique context

- Closing thoughts: AI is part of every product

### 17. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. Example: For example, if you were a developer seeing this code, it felt like choosing between the black wire and the red wire to cut if you had a time bomb in front of you:
There was even one time when someone accidentally set production services to connect to ourlatest(dev-stage) Redis instance instead of the correct prod one. It was time to build a tool that would help us move faster and safer.


**Key Points:**

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

- First, a developer pushes changes to a repo (call it Service X).

- Automated regional rollouts, powered by StatsigRelease Pipelines

- Shadow pipeline simulations

- Cost-based VM selection automation

- Highly manual configuration

- Disconnected dependencies

### 18. Empowering your team is the future of product leadership

**Date:** 2025-05-28T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. Paradoxically,trying to control everything actually reduces your control over what matters most.


**Key Points:**

- Defining outcomes that matter rather than dictating every task

- Providing context about user needs and business priorities

- Creating frameworks that enable autonomous decision-making

- Trusting your engineers to determine the "how" once they understand the "why"

- The challenge of proving value

- The two paths for product leaders

- The brute force PM

- The force-multiplier leader

### 19. Simulating Bigtable in BigQuery with Type 2 SCD modeling

**Date:** 2025-05-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Example: For example, “How does user behavior on our app change before, during, and after they obtain a premium subscription?”
We also need to store these updates in aversioned mannersince customers often want to observe how user behavior changes over time or with different properties. Bigtable’s write path also comfortably sustains millions of QPS, so cross‑region replication keeps read latency below 10 ms no matter wherever the request originates, letting us replicate it in near real-time.


**Key Points:**

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- User-property updates are generated in one of two ways (in blue). Customers either set up bulk uploads in our web console, or they use our SDKS to log them at run-time.

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

- Then, we have a Dataflow that reads those updates from Bigtable CDC, and streams those to BigQuery in near real-time.

- The current state of the Bigtable:

- The state of the Bigtable at some moment in time:

- How some property has changed over time:

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

### 20. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- How do you interpret the outcome of a non-inferiority test?

- How do you properly integrate non-inferiority tests into your company's A/B testing process?

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

- Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine.

- In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.

### 21. Fail faster, learn faster: Why &#34;done&#34; beats &#34;perfect&#34; in modern product management

**Date:** 2025-05-20T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. Shipping thin slices lets you take more at-bats, improve your swing, and learn from each attempt.


**Key Points:**

- Create feedback loops to build learnings from users quickly

- Limit the potential downsides if a feature underperforms and course correct

- Build stakeholder confidence by showing visible progress

- Collect real-world feedback that no amount of planning can substitute for

- Build organizational muscle memory for rapid learning

- Create space for high-risk, high-reward ideas that might be killed in a "perfect first time" culture

- Free up resources to pursue more opportunities rather than polishing a single feature

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

Howie Xu, Chief AI & Innovation Officer at Gen, founder of VMware’s networking division, and AI-focused investor and lecturer at Stanford
From the slow burn of AI adoption to the messy realities of product growth, the conversation was rich with honest takes, timeless lessons, and the kind of hard-won wisdom you only get from people who’ve shipped at scale.


**Key Points:**

- Ami Vora, former CPO of Faire and VP of Product at WhatsApp and Facebook Ads

- Rajeev Rajan, CTO at Atlassian and former VP of Engineering at Facebook and Microsoft

- Howie Xu, Chief AI & Innovation Officer at Gen, founder of VMware’s networking division, and AI-focused investor and lecturer at Stanford

- Ami: At WhatsApp, the focus was on reliability and making the product feel like a utility or physical object. Fewer tests, fewer changes, and a relentless commitment to stability.

- Rajeev: Atlassian steers clear of sweeping UI overhauls in Jira. “It’s like redesigning a car dashboard—you can’t mess with muscle memory.”

- Ami: “Stay on the frontier of learning. It never feels good to be bad at something—but that’s where the learning starts.”

- Rajeev: “Forget the next title. Write the book of your life—what story do you want to tell?”

### 25. Continuous promotion for infrastructure with Statsig and Pulumi

**Date:** 2025-04-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics.


**Key Points:**

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

- Deployments that must be paused for manual sign‑off orchange‑management windows

- Initialize the Statsig server SDK at the start of your deployment.

- Get deployment decision from feature flags or dynamic configs.

- Deploy the target resources.

- Approve:Manually green‑light the next phase once metrics look good.

- Pause:Hold the rollout at the current phase to gather more data or schedule windows.

### 26. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. But when CVR improves while retention craters, the illusion breaks.


**Key Points:**

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

- Hidden cost of partial coverage:blind spots compound. Teams over‑index on the few things they do measure, and leadership starts believing an incomplete trend line.

- Integrate feature flags and experiments so every featurecanbe a testby default.

- Align engineering KPIs with metrics impact, not feature launch.

- Sunset legacy code that cannot be instrumented; it taxes every future decision.

- Why enterprises struggle:each domain team owns a slice of data; merging them requires cross‑org agreements and latency‑tolerant pipelines.

- Metrics is the language of the company. Make them clear and transparent with a centralized catalog.

- For experiments, pick a couple of primary metrics and a few guardrail metrics. Try to standardize across similar experiments.

### 27. Release pipelines: Safer, staged rollouts across your infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-04-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/release-pipelines


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we believe you can move fastwithoutbreaking things. Your 1% of users could be distributed across hundreds of clusters, and if this change causes unexpected behavior in production, it could bring down your entire infrastructure stack, as every server experiences the increased CPU and memory usage.


**Key Points:**

- Roll out changes environment by environment (dev → staging → prod)

- Target specific infrastructure segments within environments (prod-us-west → prod-us-east → prod-eu)

- Control progression between stages with time intervals or manual approvals

- Monitor each stage before proceeding to the next

- Roll back instantly if issues arise at any stage

- Catch issues early, before they affect a large portion of your infrastructure

- Prevent cascading failuresacross your entire system, ensuring higher uptime

- Validate changes in real production environmentswith minimal risk

### 28. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Example: Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:
Figure 3:A P95 performance graph comparing our legacy Node SDK (green) and Node Core SDK (blue) runtime for a gate check. With Rust's memory safety, performance, concurrency, and zero-cost abstractions, the improvements to actual evaluation time have been huge enough to outweigh the binding costs.


**Key Points:**

- pyo3 (Python):Getting started - PyO3 user guide

- napi-rs (Node):Getting started – NAPI-RS

- jni-rs (Java):GitHub - jni-rs/jni-rs: Rust bindings to the Java Native Interface

- ruslter (Elixir):GitHub - rusterlium/rustler: Safe Rust bridge for creating Erlang NIF functions

- What we learned

- Join the Slack community

### 29. The rise of experimentation as the industry standard

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. Example: One notable example is the16-month TV advertising experimentAmazon ran in a few markets, which showed that TV ads delivered only a modest sales bump. In the new model we grow bylearning faster—hundreds of tiny, controlled bets that compound.


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- Experimenting with the length of forms to mitigate user dropoffs

- Using 20% of an email audience to suss out the best email subject line and sending it to the remaining 80%

- Testingvirtually anythingin a focus group

- Implementing customer surveys to gauge reactions to potential upcoming initiatives

- Jeff Bezos on the importance of experimentation

- A booming market for experimentation platforms like Statsig

- Examples of high-impact experiments

### 30. Digital marketing attribution models: A tech survey

**Date:** 2025-04-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. Example: Early versions were still rule-based (for example, splitting credit evenly or favoring the first and last touches). MMM emerged in the 1950s (though it rose to popularity in the 1980s) as a top-down approach that uses aggregate data and statistical regression to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel to sales [1].


**Key Points:**

- Shapley Value Attribution

- Algorithmic/Statistical Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ML)

- Incrementality Testing and Lift Models

- Causal Inference-Based Multi-Channel Attribution

- Customer Journey-based Deep Learning Models

- Captures sequential nature of journeys.

- Explains results via the “If we remove channel X, how many conversions are lost?” logic, which is intuitive.

- More nuanced than any single-position rule; channels that primarily appear in converting paths get more credit.

### 32. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Example: For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:
On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of. We also have tools likeCUPEDthat will control for values that we can see before the experiment, avoiding the worst of the bias and making your experiments run faster.


**Key Points:**

- You have to choose experiments that can be applied across pages, and that you'd expect to have a similar impact on each of the pages you'd apply it to.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

- Image optimizations,such as enabling lazy loading across all pages.

- Multimedia enhancements,like adding audio versions of blog posts to see if this boosts engagement or traffic.

- Challenges of SEO A/B testing

- Designing your experiment

- Sidecar no-code A/B testing

- The right tools for the job

### 33. Introducing CURE: Smarter regression, faster experiments

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/announcing-cure


**Summary:**  
Statsig is excited to announce that we’re moving out of beta testing and into full production launch for CURE - an extension of CUPED - which allows users to add arbitrary covariate data to regression adjustment in their experiments, reducing variance even further than existing CUPED implementations. Example: For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results. For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED: Controlled [Experiment] Using Pre-Experiment Data

- CURE: [Variance] Control Using Regression Estimates

- If you have a predictive model of future behaviors, you can easilyuse that as a covariate in CURE(like Doordash’s CUPAC)

- If you want to provide additional signal to the standard CUPAC approach, you canpick and choose different user attributes or behaviorsto add to the regression

- CURE brings powerful, flexible regression adjustment to every Statsig experiment.

- Our approach to regression adjustment

### 38. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. Example: For example, a treatment’s impact on revenue might be most noticeable among high-spending players, where behavioral changes are more pronounced. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects.


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type II error (β):The probability of failing to detect a true improvement when one exists.

- Set the winsorization threshold (X%):In A/B testing, common choices are 1% or 0.1%, depending on the required adjustment and sample size.

- Replace extreme values:Values beyond these thresholds are capped at the corresponding percentile values.

- Why outliers can be harmful

- How to identify outliers

- What to do with outliers

- Time for winsorization!

### 40. What no one tells you about feature flags and messy code

**Date:** 2025-03-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others. Example: Let's walk through an example. For example, if the flag is being used to slowly roll out a new checkout experience, and you're aiming for 100% rollout by the end of the month, create a “Removeff_new_checkout” ticket with a due date 30–45 days after full rollout.


**Key Points:**

- [ ] Remove all `if/else` conditions using `ff_new_checkout`

- [ ] Delete the flag from Statsig’s dashboard (mark as deprecated first)

- [ ] Remove related experiment code or tracking if applicable

- [ ] Update documentation or `FLAGS.md` if needed

- [ ] Confirmation that no users are on the legacy flow

- [ ] No recent rollbacks in the past 14 days

- When should this flag be removed?

- Who’s responsible for removing it?

### 41. Why buying an experimentation platform makes more sense than building one

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/buying-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
“Building your own experimentation platform made a lot of sense… five years ago,” says our customer Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager - Core ML at Whatnot, who previously worked on DoorDash’s in-house platform. Example: For example, over the past year we’ve shipped several advanced capabilities that you won’t find in a typical experimentation platform:
- Stats methodologies such as stratified sampling, differential impact detection, interaction detection, Benjamini Hochberg procedure etc. Over the past few years, several companies have moved away from in-house experimentation tooling and turned to Statsig to scale their experimentation cultures.Notionincreased their experimentation velocity by 30x within a year.Limewent from limited testing to experimenting on every change before rolling it out.


**Key Points:**

- Server & client-side SDKsfor seamless experimentation across all surfaces without impacting performance

- Data logging, ingestion and processing servicesand/or integration with your data warehouse

- Randomization functionsfor accurate user allocations in different scenarios

- Experiment result computationsincluding metric lifts, p-values, confidence intervals, and other statistical calculations

- Automated checks(like power analysis, balanced exposures) to ensure experiments are properly set up and issues are identified proactively

- Statistical correctionsto account for outliers, pre-experimental bias, and differential impact, etc. to provide trustworthy results

- Variance reduction(CUPED, winsorization)

- Experimentation techniqueslike sequential testing, switchback testing, geo-based tests etc.

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/data-driven-marketing-attribution-shortcomings


**Summary:**  
Ideally, you’d like a tidy calculation that says, “Channel A accounts for 25% of conversions, Channel B for 40%, Channel C for 10%,” and so on.


**Key Points:**

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

- The problem: Evaluating marketing spend in a complex landscape

- What data-driven models promise

- Where they fall short in reality

### 43. Automating BigQuery load jobs from GCS: Our scalable approach

**Date:** 2025-03-06T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/automating-bigquery-load-jobs-gcs


**Summary:**  
As our data needs evolved, we created a flexible and dynamic ingestion solution. Example: Example:
## Orchestrating workflows
We use an orchestrator configured to trigger our Python ingestion script periodically, following a cron-like schedule. Time-based bucketing of files
We organize incoming data into discrete time buckets (e.g., every 1,000 seconds).


**Key Points:**

- Automatically detect and ingest data into new tables dynamically.

- Group files into time-based buckets for organized ingestion.

- Reliably track ingestion jobs, accounting for potential delays in status reporting.

- BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS:for historical job statuses and to identify completed or failed jobs.

- MongoDB:for tracking pending and initiated jobs to mitigate delays in BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA updates.

- bq_load_source_bucket_name: Indicates the originating bucket for the load job.

- bq_load_dest_table_name: Indicates the destination table for the load job.

- bq_load_bucket_timestamp: Indicates the specific time bucket processed.

### 44. KPI traps: How &#34;successful&#34; experiments can still be failures

**Date:** 2025-03-05T00:02-08:00  
**Author:** Lin Jia  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kpi-traps-successful-experiments-can-fail


**Summary:**  
You set up the experiment cautiously, collected data diligently, and celebrated when it achieved statistical significance for your KPI. Example: For example, a company notices that customer service calls are taking too long. When they run a two-week experiment to measure the impact, they find that DAU increases as more users return to the app.


**Key Points:**

- Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever.

- Success on paper, but failure in practice

- False positive risk

- False positive risk given the success rate, p-value threshold of 0.025 (successes only), and 80% power

- How to avoid KPI traps

- Align KPIs with business goals

- Use multiple metrics including high-level objective, user behaviors, and guardrails

- Monitor long-term effects for shipped experiments

### 47. Beyond prompts: A data-driven approach to LLM optimization

**Date:** 2025-03-04T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Anna Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/llm-optimization-online-experimentation


**Summary:**  
This article presents a systematic framework for online A/B testing of LLM applications, focusing onprompt engineering, model selection, and temperature tuning. Example: ## Experiment design and statistical rigor
### Hypothesis and goal
Define a measurable hypothesis: e.g., “Adding an example to the prompt will increase correct answer rates by 5%.” This clarity guides your metrics and success criteria. By isolating and experimenting with specific factors, teams can generate tangible improvements in performance, user engagement, and cost-efficiency.


**Key Points:**

- Improve performance: Validate hypothesis-driven changes (like new prompts) directly with real users.

- Reduce costs: Pinpoint “good enough” model variants or narrower context windows that maintain quality while lowering expenses.

- Boost engagement: Track user behaviors such as conversation length, retention, or click-through rates to ensure AI experiences resonate with users.

- Randomized user allocation: Users are split—often 50/50—so each group experiences only one variant. Randomization ensures a fair comparison.

- Single variable isolation: If testing a new prompt, keep the model and temperature consistent across both variants to attribute outcome differences to prompt changes.

- A different base model (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5).

- A refined prompt with new instructions or examples.

- Altered parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p).

### 48. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Vercel Native Integration

**Date:** 2025-02-27T07:00-12:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-vercel-native-integration


**Summary:**  
Modern web development depends on a seamless experience for users and developers. Performant, fast, and reliable websites are table stakes for users in 2025.At the same time, websites and applications are becoming increasingly complex, with more features, integrations, and components contributing to the user experience. Example: For example, if you're introducing a new navigation layout, you can first enable the flag for internal users, gather feedback, and then gradually roll it out to production—all without pushing a new deployment. No developer wants to manage extra configurations, third-party dashboards, or custom integrations, and no user wants to see a page flicker on load, or experience another 100ms wait until the page renders.


**Key Points:**

- Create and manage feature flagsto control your releases

- Run experimentsto test changes and measure impact

- Gain access to Analytics, Session Replay, and other Statsig product toolsthat don’t exist natively in your Vercel dashboard

- Use Statsig’s SDKs and Edge Config syncingfor low-latency performance without additional setup

- Install the integration:Find Statsig in the Vercel Marketplace and complete the quick setup flow

- Choose a billing plan:Both plans offer generous limits: theFree tierincludes 2M events/month, while thePro tierprovides 5M events/month for just $150

- Install Statsig and connect your Statsig project: Link your Statsig project to Vercel to sync feature flags, experiments, settings, permissions, etc.

- Initialize with Vercel’s Flags SDK or Statsig's SDK:We recommend using Vercel's Flags SDK for Next.js and SvelteKit projects; use Statsig’s SDK for all other projects

### 49. What are guardrail metrics in A/B tests?

**Date:** 2025-02-26T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Michael Makris  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-are-guardrail-metrics-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Your team designed the feature well, you set ambitious business targets, you built the feature well, and designed a solid A/B test to measure the results. Example: For example, if you're testing a new user interface, your primary metric might be the click-through rate on a feature button. While you aim to improve specific aspects of your product through A/B testing, you shouldn’t compromise on the overall system and business health.


**Key Points:**

- Ensuring that gains in one area do not cause losses in another

- Providing a holistic view of the impact of your tests

- Interactions with other features

- Envision the following:

- Introduction to guardrail metrics in A/B testing

- Primary metrics vs. guardrail metrics

### 50. How Statsig uses query-level experiments to speed up Metrics Explorer

**Date:** 2025-02-20T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Nicole Smith  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/query-level-experiments-metrics-explorer


**Summary:**  
Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. However, when we’re making performance improvements to Metrics Explorer queries, we’re less concerned with a stable user experience for experimentation purposes, and more concerned with making them faster in every scenario.


**Key Points:**

- More funnel steps: When there are more funnel steps, the size of the temp table or CTE in question is more likely to be larger.

- Grouping by a field: This tends to make subsequent steps in the query more expensive, so having using a temp table may be more efficient when a group by is in place.

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

- The implementation

- Handling assignment

- Query event telemetry

### 53. Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics: Not a big deal?

**Date:** 2025-02-11T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-vs-frequentist-statistics


**Summary:**  
One common area of confusion and heated debate is the difference betweenBayesian and Frequentist approaches. In theory, they offer several advantages:
- Faster, more accurate decision-making
Faster, more accurate decision-making
- The ability to leverage past information
The ability to leverage past information
- A structured way to debate underlying assumptions
A structured way to debate underlying assumptions
Because of these benefits, some advocate for their adoption including data scientists at companies like Amazon and Netflix (ref).


**Key Points:**

- The unknown is fixed:Thetrueaverage height of adults in your city isn't changing while you're analyzing your data. It's a fixed, albeit unknown, number.

- Randomness is in the data:The randomness comes fromwhichpeople you happen to sample. If you repeated your survey many times, you'd get slightly different results each time.

- Frequentists:Focus on the long-run frequency of events. Probability is about how often something would happen if you repeated the experiment many times.

- Bayesians:Focus on the degree of belief or certainty about an unknown. Probability is a measure of how likely something is, given your current knowledge.

- Large samples:When you have a lot of data, Bayesian and Frequentist approaches tend to give very similar results. The data overwhelms any prior beliefs in the Bayesian approach.

- A Frequentist might see if a 95% confidence interval for the difference in conversion rates excludes zero.

- A Bayesian might see if a 95% credible interval for the difference lies entirely above zero.

- In most cases, they'll reach the same conclusion about which version is better.

### 57. Settings 2.0: Keeping up with a scaling product

**Date:** 2025-01-29T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Cynthia Xin  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/settings-page-design-2025


**Summary:**  
Over the past few years, Statsig has scaled significantly, adding multiple products and features to our platform. Example: In Settings 1.0, the left-side navigation menu was essentially broken down into "project" and "organization."
If users wanted to edit settings for a feature gate, for example, they needed to remember which settings were considered project settings versus organization settings, often resulting in users having to navigate different tabs just to track down one toggle. ### UI simplification
We updated the UI in Settings 2.0 to improve usability while adhering toour latest design system, Pluto.


**Key Points:**

- Members > Select a Team > Edit Team Settings

- Organization Info > Gate Settings

- Settings 2.0 introduces a main navigation and a sub-navigation

- Users can easily switch between Team, Project, and Organization settings for product features by using the sub-navigation

- We recently embarked on a journey to make our Settings page even better.

- Intuitive navigation (Product first, permission level second)

- Consolidating members, teams, and roles

- UI simplification

### 58. Stratified sampling in A/B Tests

**Date:** 2025-01-28T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/stratified-sampling-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Stratified sampling might just be the tool you need to bring clarity and precision to yourA/B testing efforts. Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison. This approach not only improves the quality of your data but also deepens your understanding of how different segments interact with your product.


**Key Points:**

- Identify key covariates: Look at past data to see which demographics or behaviors link closely with the changes you’re testing.

- Categorize your users: Group them by these identified covariates. This ensures each category is tested.

- Imagine you're running experiments to fine-tune your product, but your results swing wildly in every experiment you run.

- Introduction to stratified sampling in A/B testing

- Designing stratified samples for A/B tests

- Implementing stratified sampling in A/B tests

- Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison.

- This approach not only improves the quality of your data but also deepens your understanding of how different segments interact with your product.

### 59. The ultimate guide to building an internal feature flagging system

**Date:** 2025-01-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
“Why do people pay for this?”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions. Example: You’re also likely to find some synergies in the code you write across these two services - for example, the service that provides evaluated flag values to clients can borrow logic from the code that evaluates rulesets on your servers, provided they’re written in the same language. - Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?


**Key Points:**

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

- Handle targeting on any user trait, like app version, country, IP address, etc.?

- Have extremely high uptime?

- test a feature in production (by “gating” it to only employees/ beta testers)

- rollout a feature to only certain geographies (by “gating” on user countries)

- run an A/B test (by gating a feature to a random 50% of userIDs)

- Or Run acanary release(release a feature to a random 10% of userIDs, to check that it doesn’t break anything)

### 60. Detecting interaction effects of concurrent experiments

**Date:** 2025-01-13T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Kane Luo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/interaction-effect-detection


**Summary:**  
To accelerate experimentation, medium to large companies run hundreds of A/B tests simultaneously, aiming to isolate and measure the impact of each change, also known as the "main effect."
However, when multiple tests target the same area of your product, they can influence one another, resulting in either overestimation or underestimation of metric changes. Example: For example, to understand the effect of dark mode without the transition animation, you would compare group C to group A using a standard two-sample t-test. This expands the UI compatibility and aims to improve retention.


**Key Points:**

- Relaunch the same experimentsto a mutually exclusive audience. This is especially useful if you need more statistical power particularly on secondary metrics.

- Conduct manual statistical testsand determine which one of the two features to ship.

- If the interaction is synergistic, you candouble down on the combined experience, by either launching a new test or analyzing group A and D.

- Rework the experienceto make the feature compatible.

- Statsig now offersinteraction effect detectionto uncover the hidden effects of experiments on each other.

- Scenario: Dark mode gone wrong

- How do we diagnose it?

- My experiments are interacting—now what?

### 62. How to report test results

**Date:** 2025-01-02T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-report-test-results


**Summary:**  
Now comes the critical moment—communicating your insights to your company’s stakeholders. Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups. Analysts may prematurely generalize sample results to the population, leading to overly definitive claims such as, “This feature will increase revenue by 10%” or “The conversion rate in the new version improved by 5%.”
How to get it right: When communicating test results, it’s crucial to remember that your data reflects what happens in your sample and may not precisely represent the population.


**Key Points:**

- Secondary KPIs: For secondary KPIs, summarize the results visually or in a table that includes the uplift, the boundaries of the confidence interval, and the p-value.

- 1. Overstating certainty

- 2. Confusing Test Settings with Test Results

- 3. Misinterpreting p-values

- 4. Misinterpreting confidence interval

- 5. Ignoring external validity

- An example: Report of test’s results

- Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups.

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/key-problems-in-d2c-that-experimentation-solves


**Summary:**  
“Half your ideas will fail… you need to verify and tweak your ideas until they actually deliver value for the customer.”
– Wyatt Thompson, Dollar Shave Club
## Why D2C brands face unique challenges
Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands thrive by forging direct relationships with customers—yet this also makes them vulnerable to every friction point along the user journey. Example: For example, small tweaks to the timing or format of promotional emails can reduce churn and encourage repeat purchases within 28 days. keyword-based) or surface trending bundles (“Complete the look”) to see which approach not only increases product visibility but also boosts average order value.


**Key Points:**

- For direct-to-consumer brands, data-driven testing is the real game-changer.

- Why D2C brands face unique challenges

- Friction during first-time conversions

- Overlooked opportunities in product discovery

### 64. One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/one-tailed-vs-two-tailed-tests


**Summary:**  
If your answer is no—or if you’re not even sure what this means—then this blog is for you! Example: Reviewing the previous graph can help illustrate this: for example, a result in the left tail might be significant under a two-tailed hypothesis but not under a right one-tailed hypothesis. Note that the purple area is larger for the one-tailed hypothesis, compared to the two-tailed hypothesis:
In practice, to maintain the desired power level, we compensate for the reduced power of a two-tailed hypothesis by increasing the sample size (Increasing sample size raises power, though the mechanics of this can be a topic for a separate article).


**Key Points:**

- One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Hypothesis Testing: Understanding the Difference

- Why does it make a difference?

- How to decide between one-tailed and two-tailed hypothesis?

**Date:** 2024-12-12T03:15+00:00  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/you-dont-need-large-sample-sizes-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Yet many small and medium-sized companies aren’t running A/B Tests. Example: Google routinely runs large search tests on a massive scale, for example 100,000,000 users where a+0.1% effect on topline metrics is a big win. A/B testing is a pillar of data-driven product development irrespective of the product’s size
### Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing
Startup companies have a major advantage in experimentation:huge potential and upside.Startups don’t play the micro-optimization game; they don’t care about a +0.2% increase in click-through rates.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED(Controlled Experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) leverages historical metrics to reduce noise and refine your estimates.

- Stratified Samplingensures balanced and reliable comparisons across small, skewed user segments.

- Differential Impactcan reveal directional and qualitative findings, providing a little more color to the results of your experiment.

- Small companies’ secret advantage in experimentation

- Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing

- Bayesian A/B test calculator

- Google vs a startup: Who has more statistical power?

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-ab-testing-platforms-make-data-science-more-interesting


**Summary:**  
A/B testing platforms have become highly efficient, automating much of the mundane work involved in setting up, calculating, and reporting on experiments. Example: "An engineer that improves server performance by ten milliseconds more than pays for his or her fully loaded annual costs."
Illustrating the tangible impact of small improvements, Kohavi shared this powerful example. ## Excerpts
"Most experiments fail to improve the metrics they were designed to improve."
Kohavi highlighted a counterintuitive reality: the majority of experiments don't yield the expected positive results.


**Key Points:**

- What’s the current state of experimentation automation since the release of the Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (the "Hippo" book)?

- How does this automation impact the role of data scientists?

- What should data scientists focus on moving forward?

**Author:** Sam Miller  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-config-propagation-time-with-target-apps


**Summary:**  
Propagation latency is defined as the time it takes for a change made in the Console to be reflected by the config checks you issue on your frontend or backend systems with our SDKs. Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps.


**Key Points:**

- Performance: By filtering out irrelevant configurations, the payload sent to each SDK instance is smaller, leading to faster initialization times and lower memory usage

- At Statsig, we’re constantly finding ways to drive down what we call config propagation latency.

- What are target apps?

- Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps.

### 85. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Example: Funnels allow you to measure complex relationships with a higher degree of clarity.For example, you see revenue flatten, but product page views are going up. If you care about improving your checkout flow for products, tracking this data at a session level is more powerful, measuring (successes / tries) instead of (successful users / users who tried)
Consider when a user vs.


**Key Points:**

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- Statistical rigor:Make sure funnel conversions have the delta method applied and have sound practices for ordinal logic.

- Ordered events:For funnels to be really useful, you should be able to specify that users do events in a specific sequence over time.

- Multiple-step funnels:Two-step funnels can be useful, but the ability to add intermediate steps as needed for richer understanding is critical.

- Step-level and overall conversion changes:This is how you can identifywheredrop-offs happen.

- Calculation windows:Being able to specify the maximum duration a user has to finish a funnel is critical to running longer experiments.

**Author:** Morgan Scalzo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-experimentation-infrastructure-and-culture-ronny-kohavi


**Summary:**  
We recently hosted a virtual meetup featuring Allon Korem, CEO ofBell, and Ronny Kohavi, awidely respected thought leaderand expert in experimentation. Example: For example, a p-value of 0.01 does not mean there is a 99% chance of success. - Experimentation culture: Establishing an organizational culture that embraces experimentation is vital for continuous growth and improvement.


**Key Points:**

- Case study: Only 12% of 1,000 experiments succeeded, illustrating the harsh reality that many organizations must accept—a high failure rate is normal.

- Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches: They covered the differences between these two statistical approaches and their applications in experimentation.

- A/A tests as best practice: RunningA/A testsis strongly recommended to validate experimentation setups and ensure the reliability of testing infrastructure.

- Asymmetric allocation: This approach can provide advantages to the larger group in an experiment, optimizing for specific outcomes.

- You can always learn something from people with lots of experience.

- Key insights from Ronny Kohavi

**Date:** 2024-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/technical-insights-to-a-scalable-experimentation-system


**Summary:**  
(2022)highlighted, establishing trust in experimental results is challenging. Example: For example, a differential baseline between groups prior to a treatment is not statistically biased, but it is undesirable for making business decisions and usually requires resetting the test. In such cases, the cost of maintaining more experiments increases super-linearly, while the benefits increase sub-linearly.


**Key Points:**

- Historical Relevance:Experiments serve both decision-making and learning purposes, requiring a comprehensive understanding of both current and past experiments.

- Managerial incentives often encourage detrimental behaviors, such as p-hacking.

- Experiments may result in technical debt by leaving configurations within the codebase.

- The marginal return of experiments increases linearly or sub-linearly with scale, as less effort is available to turn information into impact.

- The marginal cost of experiments increases super-linearly with scale due to information and managerial overhead.

- Default-on experiments on all new features.

- Define metrics once, use everywhere.

- Reliable, traceable, and transparent data.

### 89. Why the uplift in A/B tests often differs from real-world results

**Date:** 2024-08-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-the-uplift-in-a-b-tests-often-differs-from-real-world


**Summary:**  
This disconnect can be puzzling and disappointing, especially when decisions and expectations are built around these tests. Example: A common example I’ve encountered with clients involves tests that yield inconclusive (non-significant) results. While reducing the significance level can decrease the number of false positives, it would also require longer test durations, which may not always be feasible.


**Key Points:**

- Human bias in analysis and interpretation

- False positives

- Sequential testing and overstated effect sizes

- Novelty effect and user behavior

- External validity and real-world factors

- Limited exposure in testing

- Strategies for mitigating discrepancies

### 91. How to plan test duration when using CUPED

**Date:** 2024-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-plan-test-duration-cuped


**Summary:**  
You understand that failing to plan the test duration can lead to underpowered tests and inflated false positive rates due to peeking. Example: Example:
In reality, we don't know the true values of the variables, so we must estimate them. Recently, you've been introduced toCUPED, an advanced statistical method that reduces KPI variance, resulting in more sensitive tests (lower MDE) or shorter test durations (lower sample size).


**Key Points:**

- Calculate the Non-CUPED Sample Size: Use the regular t-test sample size formula.

- Adjust Sample Size: Reduce the calculated sample size by the factor of \(\rho^2\).

- Suppose the non-CUPED sample size is 1000.

- Historical sampled data shows an estimated Pearson correlation of 0.9 between \(X\) and \(Y\).

- Calculate the variance reduction factor: \(0.9^2 = 0.81\).

- Adjust the sample size: \(1000 \times (1 - 0.81) = 190\).

- What is test planning and why is it important?

### 98. Top 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them

**Date:** 2024-07-18T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/top-8-common-experimentation-mistakes-how-to-fix


**Summary:**  
I recently down with Allon Korem, CEO ofBell Statistics, and Tyler VanHaren, Software Engineer at Statsig, to discuss some of the most frequent mistakes companies can make in A/B testing and experimentation! I've summarized the discussion and outlined the 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them. By addressing these common testing mistakes, companies can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of their A/B tests.


**Key Points:**

- Data integrity:Ensure that your allocation point is consistent and verify your distributions using chi-squared tests to detect sample ratio mismatches.

- Skepticism and Vigilance:Regularly check data integrity over different segments and time periods to identify inconsistencies early.

- Proper Metrics:Collaborate with data science teams to ensure metrics are correctly defined and measured, focusing on meaningful business-driven KPIs.

- Statistical Methods:Use t-tests for means and z-tests for proportions in most cases. Ensure your statistical tests are relevant to your hypotheses.

- Peeking:Use sequential testing approaches to manage peeking. Tools like Statsig provide inflated confidence intervals for early data to mitigate premature conclusions.

- Underpowered Tests:Plan tests meticulously using power analysis calculators to ensure you have sufficient data to detect the expected changes.

- Handling Outliers:Use Windsorization to cap extreme values rather than removing outliers entirely, maintaining the integrity of your data.

- Cultural Challenges:Foster a culture that encourages upfront hypothesis formulation and continuous learning from experimentation.

### 99. Introducing Differential Impact Detection 

**Date:** 2024-07-17T09:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/differential-impact-detection


**Summary:**  
Statsig can now automatically surface heterogenous treatment effects across your user properties. In experimentation “one size fits all” is not always true. Example: For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users. For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users.


**Key Points:**

- Investigate the top sub-populations across each user property that you specify as a “Segment of Interest”

- For each primary metric in the experiment, determine if any sub-population has a different response to treatment

- Automatically surface a visualization of metrics sliced by user segments where one or more sub-population behaves significantly differently from the rest of the population

- Apply Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparison (check implementation details at the end)

- Concise Summarization of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Using Total Variation Regularized Regression

- Online Controlled Experiments: Introduction, Pitfalls, and Scaling(see pitfall 6: failing to look at segments)

### 101. How to Ingest Data Into Statsig

**Date:** 2024-07-16T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Logan Bates  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-ingest-data-into-statsig


**Summary:**  
During my endeavors as a data engineer, I’d spend hours helping teams translate data models and building data pipelines between software tools so they could effectively communicate. The frustration of getting the data into tools often spoiled the intended initial experience and added complexities to a production implementation. Event filters can be utilized to reduce downstream event volume to Statsig, so only your relevant metrics are analyzed.


**Key Points:**

- Access to your data source (e.g., data warehouse, 3rd party data tool/CDP, or application code).

- Necessary permissions to read from and write to your data source. (if applicable)

- Familiarity with SQL (if you're using a data warehouse)

- Use thelogEventmethod in various languages to quickly populate Statsig with data for experimentation and analysis

- Log additional metrics alongside 3rd party or internal logging systems to enhance measurement capabilities

- Use in situations where the SDKs are not supported or preferred

- Can be used to support custom metric ingestion workflows

- Quickly populate Statsig with metric data and analyze with themetrics explorer

### 102. Product experimentation best practices

**Date:** 2024-07-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-experimentation-best-practices


**Summary:**  
A good design document eliminates much of the ambiguity and uncertainty often encountered in the analysis and decision-making stages. Example: For example:
- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
### Power analysis, allocation, and duration
Allocation
This is the percentage of the user base that will be eligible for this experiment. These often include:
- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Se


**Key Points:**

- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)

- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)

- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric

- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs

- Running concurrent, mutually exclusive experiments requires allocating a fraction of the user base to each experiment.  On Statsig this is handled withLayers.

- A smaller allocation may be preferable for high-risk experiments, especially when the overall user base is large enough.

- For guardrail metrics: The MDE should be the largest regression size you’re willing to miss and ship unknowingly.

- Use power analysis to determine the duration needed to reach the MDE for each the those primary metrics. If they yield different results, pick the longest one.

### 108. Statsig&#39;s Autotune adds contextual bandits for personalization

**Date:** 2024-06-26T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-autotune-contextual-bandits-personalization


**Summary:**  
These contextual bandits are a lightweight form of reinforcement learning that gives teams an easy way to personalize user experiences. Example: For example, a contextual bandit is a great choice to personalize if a user should see “Sports”, “Science”, or “Celebrities” as their top video unit; but it won’t be a good fit for determining which video (with new candidates every day, and with potentially tens of thousands of options) to show them. Running a few tests with Autotune AI can quickly give signal on how much there is to gain from personalizing product surfaces - potentially justifying investing in a dedicated team
## Start measuring your personalization
Hundreds of customers already use Statsig to measure improvements to theirpersonalization program.


**Key Points:**

- Don’t yet have the bandwidth to solve these problems, but want a placeholder for personalization as their teams get more mission-critical parts of their product built

- We’re excited to announce that Statsig’s multi-armed bandit platform (Autotune)now includes contextual bandits.

- When to use contextual bandits

- Hit the perfect note with Autotuned experiments

- Bring your own training data

**Date:** 2024-06-25T12:15-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/warehouse-native-year-in-review


**Summary:**  
Since then, Warehouse Native has grown into a core product for us; we treat it with the same priority as Statsig Cloud, and have developed the two products to share core infrastructure, methodology, and design philosophies. Example: - More tools in the warehouse; for example, we have a beta version ofMetrics Explorerfor warehouse native customers and are excited to continue developing this - sharing a metric definition language between quick metric explorations and advanced statistical calculations helps bridge the gap between exploratory work and rigorous measurement. One of the competitive advantages we think Statsig has is “clock speed” - we just build faster than other teams building the same thing.


**Key Points:**

- Willingness - and internal/external alignment - to ship things that were functional-but-ugly

- Letting the development team play to their strengths

- Treating early customers like team members

- An Engineering “Code Machine” - someone who could crank out quality code twice as fast as other engineers

- A PM “Tech Lead” - someone who leads efforts across the company

- A DS “Product Hybrid” - someone who bridges product and engineering to solve complex business problems

- A year ago, Statsig announced Warehouse Native, bringing our experimentation platform into customers’ Data Warehouses.

- Why warehouse native?

### 119. How to debug your experiments and feature rollouts

**Date:** 2024-05-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-debug-your-experiments-and-feature-rollouts


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a product manager, or a software engineer, you know that even the most meticulously planned test rollout can encounter unexpected hiccups. Example: Statsig also allows you to override specific users, for example, if you wanted to test your feature with employees first in production. Statsig also offersstratified sampling; When experimenting on a user base where a tail-end of power users drive a large portion of an overall metric value, stratified sampling meaningfully reduces false positive rates and makes your results more consistent and trustworthy.


**Key Points:**

- Inadequate sampling: A sample that's too small or not representative of an evenly weighted distribution can lead to inconclusive or misleading results.

- Lack of confidence in metrics: Without trustworthy success metrics, it's harder to determine how to make a decision.

- User exposure issues: If users aren't exposed to the experiment as intended, your data won't reflect their true behavior.

- Biased experiments: Running multiple experiments that affect the same variables can contaminate your results.

- Technical errors: Bugs in the code can introduce unexpected variables that impact the experiment's outcome.

- Success criteria: Before launching an experiment, it's crucial to define how you’re measuring success. Make these metrics readily available for analysis.

- Running experiments mutually exclusively: To prevent experiments from influencing each other, consider using feature flagging frameworks.

- When it comes to digital experimentation and feature rollouts, the devil is often in the details.

As the quick experiment tool evolved, and its experimental rigor increased which ultimately caused us to lose our ability to create simple A/B tests like Gatekeeper originally allowed.


**Key Points:**

- Feature flags and experiments are indispensable tools in the software-building toolkit—but for different reasons.

- Feature flags, for shipping decisively

- Experiments, for seeking understanding

- The distinction between the two

- The benefits of a unified platform

- Centralized analysis and control

- Data consistency and real-time diagnostics

- End-to-end visibility

### 139. How to monitor the long term effects of your experiment

**Date:** 2024-03-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-monitor-the-long-term-effects-of-your-experiment


**Summary:**  
Now, imagine discovering six months later that it actually reduced long-term retention. Example: Let's get practical with an example from Statsig.


**Key Points:**

- User behavior is unpredictable: Users might initially react positively to a new feature but lose interest over time.

- External factors: Events outside your control, such as a global pandemic, can drastically alter user engagement and skew your experiment results.

- You then model these early signals against historical data of known long-term outcomes. This helps predict the eventual impact on retention.

- It's important to choose surrogate indexes wisely. They must have a proven correlation with the long-term outcome you care about.

- Engaged user biasmeans you're mostly hearing from your power users. They're not your average customer, so their feedback might lead you down a narrow path.

- Selective sampling issuesoccur when you only look at a subset of users. This might make you miss out on broader trends.

- Diversify your data sources: Don't rely solely on one type of user feedback. Look at a mix of both highly engaged users and those less active.

- Use stratified sampling: This means you'll divide your user base into smaller groups or strata based on characteristics like usage frequency. Then, sample evenly from these groups.

### 140. Demystifying identity resolution

**Date:** 2024-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/demystifying-identity-resolution


**Summary:**  
The notion of “identity resolution” in the SaaS world continues to be an elusive gold standard that businesses want to solve in order to understand the full scope of customer behaviors across all touch-points. Example: ## Example ID resolution scenarios
Scenario 1:An unknown user visits the website and gets assigned to the “Test” group fornav_v2experiment using via a deviceID.


**Key Points:**

- No technology providers will solve every use-case and scenario perfectly, though many will make bold claims. There is a ton of nuance here and no one-size-fits-all solution.

- It is strictly impossible to reliably identify a single human interacting anonymously on two different devices that never identify themselves.

- Unknown user identity becomes the crux of the challenge. When switching devices, browsers, environments (server vs. client), or clearing device storage, this ID will not persist.

- The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds.

- A few disclaimers, debunkings, and considerations as we dive in:

- Identity boundary basics

- What does this have to do with experimentation?

### 141. How much does a product analytics platform cost?

**Date:** 2024-03-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-much-does-a-product-analytics-platform-cost


**Summary:**  
Pricing for analytics is rarely transparent. Example: For example, Amplitude Plus comes with Feature Flags, CDP capabilities, and Session Replay.


**Key Points:**

- Amplitude Growth starts in the middle of the pack but spikes around 10M events / month (when our model means a customer crosses 200K MTUs).

- Statsig is consistently the least expensive throughout the curve. In case you think we’re biased, pleasecheck our work!

- When you’re buying a product analytics platform, it’s hard to know if you’re getting good value.

### 145. Ad blockers&#39; impact on your feature management and testing tools

**Date:** 2023-11-16T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ad-blockers-feature-management-testing-tools


**Summary:**  
There are many browser extensions out there today available to web users that help them block pesky ads around the web.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig’s presence on the block lists is less than other providers at the time of writing this, likely due to the fact that we were founded more recently—but this could change!

- Users with privacy blockers may wish to not be tracked at all, in which case it is best to respect that preference!

- According to new research, somewhere around40% of global internet users employ some form of ad-blocking technology.

### 146. Onboarding for growth with A/B tests

**Date:** 2023-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/onboarding-for-growth-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
For B2B SaaS applications, a user’s very first login or download experience has a significant influence on their engagement metrics. Example: Example experiment hypothesis: Tooltip pop-ups at every screen might empower users to progress through the onboarding workflow, thereby increasing the percentage of onboarding completions and subsequently active usage. The quicker you guide them to this revelation (decrease time-to-value), the more likely they are to become sticky, which significantly impacts core metrics such as daily active users (DAU) and ultimately retention and net recurring revenue (NRR).


**Key Points:**

- Incorporating contextual tooltips or pop-ups that empower users to navigate through the workflow (sometimes even including a brief autoplay tutorial)

- Highlighting specific high-value feature(s) that give early wins for users

- Featuring a “one-click quick start” or similar capability that automatically configures basic parameters for immediate use of features

- Offering different plans such as a free trial with limited features vs a premium trial with full access

- Personalizing messaging based on the user's persona such as their industry or role

- Offering discounts in the eleventh hour is not the growth strategy of champions.

- Successful onboarding-for-growth implementations

- Testing and identifying winning features

### 148. Lessons from Notion: How to build a great AI product, if you&#39;re not an AI company

**Date:** 2023-06-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/notion-how-to-build-an-ai-product


**Summary:**  
Imagine that you’re the CEO of a successful documents company. You know it’s time to build an AI product. Example: With the rate at which the AI space is changing, there will be constant opportunities to improve the AI product by:
- Swapping out models (i.e., replacing GPT-3.5-turbo with GPT-4)

### 149. Online experimentation: The new paradigm for building AI applications

**Date:** 2023-04-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Palak Goel and Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-products-require-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:
First, product managers would come up with a new idea for a product and lay out a release timeline. Example: But the risks are palpable—for every AI success story, there’s an example of a biased model sharing misinformation, or a feature being pulled due to safety concerns. #### In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today.


**Key Points:**

- How can you launch and iterate on features quickly without compromising your existing user experience?

- How can you move fast while ensuring your apps are safe and reliable?

- How can you ensure that the features you launch lead to substantive, differentiated improvements in user outcomes?

- How can you identify the optimal prompts and models for your specific use case?

- Build compelling AI features that engage users

- Flight dozens of models, prompts and parameters in the ‘back end’ of these features

- Collect data on all inputs and outputs

- Use this data to select the best-performing variant and fine-tune new models

**Author:** Geunbae &#34;GB&#34; Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-importance-of-design-in-b2b-saas


**Summary:**  
The expectations of a delightful user experience—previously reserved for the realm of B2C products—have bled into B2B space as well, with enterprise customers expecting to be delighted by the look and feel of the products that they’re using. Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.


**Key Points:**

- A well-designed product is a strong foundation

- A well-designed product is your value prop, an edge vs. competitors

- A well-designed product helps your team to move faster

- A well-designed product is key in establishing your brand

- Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-with-your-warehouse


**Summary:**  
This makes it so that you can use your existing events and metrics with Statsig’s experimentation engine. Based on the previous pain points, we built the new approach with the following goals in mind:
- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started
Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started
- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
- Keep things consistent: We’ll treat your imported data just the same as SDK data, materializing into experiment results, creating tracking datasets, and eventually allowing you to explore it in tools like Events Explorer.


**Key Points:**

- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started

- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig

- In your Statsig metrics page, you’ll be able to find the new “Ingestions” tab

- Here, you can give us connection information for one of the supported data warehouses

- You’ll give us a SQL snippet that provides a view for your base metric or event data. This can be as simple as aSELECT *from your existing table!

- In the console, you’ll be able to map your existing fields into Statsig fields

- Once that’s done you can preview the data we’ll pull, set an ingestion schedule, and optionally load some recent historical data to get started.

- Running a scheduled pull and processing your data on your chosen schedule

### 154. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Example: For example, if you typed “#m lgtm” the bot would respond with the macro lgtm, an image of a doge saying looks good to me. A few main reasons:
- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.


**Key Points:**

- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Within the Admin Panel -> Select Integrations -> Click Create custom integration

- Within Permissions, check “Group chat bot”, “Message any member”, and “Read all messages”

- You should get back a url that looks like this:http://71c8-216-207-142-218.ngrok.io. Input that as the callback url in the page webhook.

- Open uphttp://localhost:4040/in your browser. Here is where you can see requests sent and received by your webhook.

- Create a new Workplace group chat with your favorite coworkers and your bot, and trigger your bot by calling one of your macros such as “#m lgtm”

- Usehttp://localhost:4040/and console to debug as needed

**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
They’re trying several ideas at any given time. If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.


**Key Points:**

- Have a clear set of questions the holdout is designed to answer. This will guide your design, holdout duration, value you get and will dictate what costs make sense to incur.

- Understand the costs associated with holdouts. Make sure teams that will pay those costs understand holdout goals and buy in.

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Feature Level Holdouts

- Measuring Cumulative Impact

- If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts!) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way. Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.


**Key Points:**

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

- The target population is split randomly for a test, where some get the solution (Test) and some don’t (Control)

- Unrealized Value: Testing to Understand

- Don’t Waste Your Tests: Take Time to Think About The Results

- Parting Thoughts

### 160. Modernizing the Customer Data Stack

**Date:** 2022-04-18T21:30:15.000Z  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/modernizing-the-customer-data-stack


**Summary:**  
There are two key factors influencing this rapid modernization:
- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.


**Key Points:**

- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.

- Businesses want to leverage rapidly evolving and automated data intelligence inside their customer-facing applications.

- Websites, mobile applications and server side applications.

- If a business is generating calculated metrics, model outputs or cohorts in a warehouse, that ultimately becomes a data producer as well.

- Help desks, payment systems, marketing tools, A/B testing tools, ad platforms, CRMs, etc.

- Too many custom pipelines, SDKs and transformations decrease the fidelity and manageability of data over time.

- It’s impossible to enforce schema standardization across channels without introducing latency (Everyone loves a bolt onMDM… right?).

- It’s impossible to resolve user identities across channels without complex user identity services, which introduce latency.

### 162. Democratizing Experimentation

**Date:** 2022-03-21T05:41:41.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/democratizing-experimentation


**Summary:**  
When building out instant games on Facebook a few years back, a new developer switched to use a newer version of an internal SDK. Example: (once measures turn into goals, it’s possible to incent behavior that’s undesirable unless we’re prudent; see theHanoi Rat Problemfor an interesting example)
Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want? A more experienced teammate noticed the change reduced time spent in the game.


**Key Points:**

- Is the metric movement explainable?

- Are all significant movements being reported, not just the positive ones?

- Are guardrail metrics being violated?

- Is there a quota we’re drawing from?

- Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want?

- Guarding againstp-hacking (or selective reporting)(often by establishing guidelines like using ~14 day windows to report results over;see more about reading results safely here.)

- Amazon famously reduced distractions during checkout flows to improve conversion. This is a pattern that most ecommerce sites now optimize for.

- Experiment Review Best Practices

### 164. Introducing Autotune: Statsig’s Multiarmed Bandit

**Date:** 2022-02-03T20:33:11.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-autotune


**Summary:**  
MAB is a well-known probability problem that involves balancing exploration vs exploitation (Ref. Example: ### Case Study: A Real Autotune Test on statsig.com
Statsig’s website (www.statsig.com) showcases Statsig’s products and offerings. We provide a few parameters to play with, but for most use-cases you can use the defaults like we did:
- exploration window (default = 24 hrs) — The initial time that Autotune will evenly split traffic.


**Key Points:**

- Determining which product(s) to feature on a one-day Black Friday sale (resource = time, payout = revenue).

- Showing the best performing ad given a limited budget (resource = budget, payout = clicks/visits).

- Selecting the best signup flow given a finite amount of new users (resource = new users, payout = signups).

- Maximizing Gain:When resources are scarce and maximizing payoff is critical.

- Multiple Variations:Bandits are good at focusing traffic on the most promising variations. Bandits can be quite useful vs traditional A/B testing when there are >4 variations.

- winner threshold (default = 95%) — The confidence level Autotune will use to declare a winner and begin diverting 100% of traffic towards.

- statsig.logEvent(‘click’):Logs a successful click. This combined with getConfig() allows Autotune to compute the click-thru rate.

- Under an A/B/C/D test, 75% of the traffic would have been diverted to inferior variations (vs 42% for Autotune).

**Date:** 2022-01-21T19:40:18.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/definitive-guide-ecommerce-growth


**Summary:**  
I’ve done it thrice, first with Flipkart, then with a company that I founded myself, then at Amazon. Example: For example, anA/B testfor checkout on the Vancouver Olympic Store showed that a single page checkout performed 21.8% better than the multi-step checkout. Large improvements deeper in the funnel require a smaller sample size to test and make every upstream step more effective.


**Key Points:**

- E-commerce is hard.

- 1. Optimizing Conversion Rate

- Crushing the Gloom of Cart Abandonment

- Lighting-up Add-to-Cart Conversions

- 2. Growing Visitors

- Content is Central

- Double Down by Targeting

- Not to Forget Virality

### 168. How Statsig Designs SDKs for Different Application Environments

**Date:** 2021-10-22T05:10:07.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in. Example: For example, our JavaScript client SDK is only12kb minified + Gzipped. #### At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

- 1. Serves a single user at a time

- 2. Not in a secure environment, i.e. assume everything is public

- 3. The device is not always connected to the Internet

- 4. Sensitive to binary size, data usage and latency

- 1. Serves many users from one machine

- 2. Each server runs for a long time

- Example: For example, our JavaScript client SDK is only12kb minified + Gzipped.

### 170. Embrace Overlapping A/B Tests and Avoid the Dangers of Isolating Experiments

**Date:** 2021-10-08T06:44:42.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/embracing-overlapping-a-b-tests-and-the-danger-of-isolating-experiments


**Summary:**  
How to handle simultaneous experiments frequently comes up. Example: For example, one cannot test new ranking algorithm A (vs control) and also new ranking algorithm B (vs control) in overlapping tests. This method maintains experimental power, but can reduce accuracy (as I’ll explain later, this is not a major drawback).


**Key Points:**

- Isolated tests— Users are split into segments, and each user is enrolled in only one experiment. Your experimental power is reduced, but accuracy of results are maintained.

- Microsoft’s Online Controlled Experiments At Scale

- How Google Conducts More experiments

- Can You Run Multiple AB Tests At The Same Time?

- Large Scale Experimentation at Spotify

- Running Multiple A/B Tests at The Same Time: Do’s and Dont’s

- AtStatsig, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting many experimentalists from different backgrounds and experiences.

- Managing Multiple Experiments

### 171. A/B testing for dummies

**Date:** 2021-10-06T00:37:45.000Z  
**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ab-testing-for-dummies


**Summary:**  
Since then, my level of understanding has graduated from preschool to elementary- nice! Example: Let me give you an example- for awhile, Facebook was testing out pimple popping videos to engage more folks on video. A/B testing means we can try out more features and quickly see which ones work.Instead of just holding onto one idea and running with it for 6 months, by progressively rolling out new ideas all the time, companies build better products faster.


**Key Points:**

- This is what I googled on my first day with Statsig.

- Example: Let me give you an example- for awhile, Facebook was testing out pimple popping videos to engage more folks on video.

- A/B testing means we can try out more features and quickly see which ones work.Instead of just holding onto one idea and running with it for 6 months, by progressively rolling out new ideas all the time, companies build better products faster.

**Date:** 2021-07-30T07:12:08.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-auth0-nailed-demand-generation


**Summary:**  
Similarly, reducing friction during evaluation means that we enable these leads to get qualified as efficiently as possible. Example: Let’s use a case study to see how a well-oiled demand generation engine works. #### Automating Demand Generation in Three Steps
Product-led Growth (PLG) is magical because it does two things really well:
- It reduces the cost of acquiring leads
It reduces the cost of acquiring leads
- It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product

**Date:** 2021-05-05T05:41:52.000Z  
**Author:** Rodrigo Roim  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ruid-time-travel-safe-distributed-unique-64-bit-ids-generated-in-rust


**Summary:**  
AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration. - Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.


**Key Points:**

- 41 bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- 14 bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- 9 bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

- Defining a millisecond maximum time travel thresholdMMTTT(sometimes shortened asM2T3).

- Comparing the current generation timestampCtwith the previous generation timestampPt. WhenCt < Ct + MMTTT < Pt, RUIDs are generated withPtas the timestamp.

- Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

**Date:** 2025-10-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Daniel Loomb  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/profiling-server-core-how-we-cut-memory-usage


**Summary:**  
The goal was simple: optimize a single codebase and see the results across every server SDK. #### Server Core v0.2.0
When we first launched Server Core, we hadn't yet invested the time to improve memory.


**Key Points:**

- Our Legacy Statsig Python SDK at version 0.64.0

- Our Server Core Python SDK at version 0.2.0 (before memory optimizations)

- Our Server Core Python SDK at version 0.9.3 (latest optimizations)

- Strings consumed 56 MB.Repeated values like "idType": "userID" appeared thousands of times.

- Repeated values like "idType": "userID" appeared thousands of times.

- DynamicReturnable objects consumed 69 MB.They were often duplicated across experiments and layers.

- They were often duplicated across experiments and layers.

- Makes cloning cheap (critical for when the SDK logs exposures, where strings can be repeated frequently).

### 4. Sink, swim, or scale: What startups teach us about launching AI

**Date:** 2025-08-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Alexey Komissarouk  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-startups-lessons-learned


**Summary:**  
About the guest author.Alexey Komissarouk is aGrowth Engineering Advisorwho teachesGrowth Engineering on Reforge. Previously, he was the Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Early users, however, complained they “still didn’t know what to do with this thing.”Notion pivotedfrom “AI writes for you” to “AI improves what you’ve already written,” redesigned starter prompts, and saw usage rise as the mental cost of exploration dropped.


**Key Points:**

- Pre‑negotiate burst capacity with vendors (spot GPUs, secondary clouds, reseller credits) so you scale up within minutes without surprise bills.

- Offer a “happy hour” off‑peak tier that absorbs hobby traffic without harming premium latency.

- Replace blank prompt boxes with role‑based starter chips and one‑click examples that autofill.

- Instrument “prompt redo” and “undo” events as frustration signals; run weekly funnel reviews on them.

- Offer an “explain my last prompt” toggle—turning trial‑and‑error into guided learning.

- When financially viable, start with a flat plan that eliminates mental transaction costs; layer in usage-based overages only once users reach actual ceilings.

- Expose “token burn so far” inside the interface, not tucked away in billing dashboards.

- Run price‑sensitivity experiments onengagedcohorts, not top‑of‑funnel sign‑ups; willingness to pay lags perceived mastery.

### 5. Optimizing cloud compute costs with GKE and compute classes

**Date:** 2025-07-25T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-cloud-compute-costs-with-gke-and-compute-classes


**Summary:**  
Anyone who has optimized cloud compute costs knows that spot nodes can significantly reduce your bill. Example: But we found that node weighting alone has significant limitations:
- Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling
Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling
- Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time
Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time
### Detailed real-world example
To showcase why this is problematic here is a detailed example. ### How do you reduce your cloud compute costs without using a third-party vendor?


**Key Points:**

- Loss of Control: You're entrusting third-party providers with your node management, which could risk disrupting your workflows with opaque algorithms

- Cost: These services can significantly add to your operational expenses

- Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling

- Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time

- Pool A: Cheapest spot nodes, high preemption rate (5% per hour)

- Pool B: Moderately priced spot nodes, lower preemption rate (2% per hour)

- Pool C: Non-spot nodes, most expensive, zero preemption

- Initial State: All workloads run on Pool A (100 nodes).

### 7. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. Example: Another great example is Notion AI, which writes and summarizes within your existing workspace. Keep response time below 200 ms and uptime above 99.9 %, and you’ve passed.


**Key Points:**

- Google's Geminioutperformed GPT-4 on 30 of 32 benchmarksand beat humans on language understanding tests. Once deployed, it suggestedadding glue to pizzato make cheese stick better.

- Perplexity faced lawsuitsforcreating fake news sectionsand falsely attributing content to real publications.

- Note: We recently launched our Evals product that solves this problem - clickhereto learn more

- Monitor success metrics.These metrics become your real quality benchmarks. The easiest way to do this is with product analytics.

- Watch user sessions.Record user interactions to understand the stories behind metrics - why users drop off, where confusion occurs, when they ignore AI suggestions.

- Ship big changes as A/B tests.Do 50/50 rollouts of what you think will be big wins to quantify the impact. This helps your team build intuition for what actually moves the needle.

- Expand.Ship features to larger and larger groups of users, monitoring success metrics and bad outcomes as you go.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

### 8. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift.


**Key Points:**

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

- It is less susceptible to external shocks (holidays, marketing pulses).

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- Use proxies, not your KPIs

- Boost signal and reduce noise with thoughtful statistics

- Covariate adjustment (CUPED & CURE)

### 9. Move forward: The A/B testing mindset guide

**Date:** 2025-06-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Israel Ben Baruch  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/move-forward-the-a-b-testing-mindset-guide


**Summary:**  
Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time. It sharpens your thinking and helps you act faster if your current test fails.


**Key Points:**

- Be obsessed.You check results more than you should. You run through your funnels again and again. Your head swarms with ideas. You’re not crazy, you’re exactly where you should be.

- Organizational culture.Your mindset needs an organization that supports it - one that encourages people to take risks, experiment, and always push forward.

- Professional expertise.CRO is a craft. Find the people, the content, and the companies to learn from. Apply. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. Most importantly: keep evolving.

- Great tools.Use high-quality, reliable measurement and testing platforms. They’re the foundation of effective testing. No compromises.

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

### 10. Experimentation and AI: 4 trends we’re seeing 

**Date:** 2025-06-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. Example: Example: It has become common for chat interface-based apps (like ChatGPT, Vercel V0, Lovable) to experiment with suggested prompts to help users quickly discover and realize value, which subsequently drives engagement and retention.


**Key Points:**

- Good logging on all the product metrics you care about

- The ability to link these metrics to everything you release

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

- Trend 2: More AI code drives the need for quantitative optimization

- Trend 3: Every engineer is a growth engineer

- Trend 4: Product value comes from your unique context

- Closing thoughts: AI is part of every product

### 11. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. Example: For example, if you were a developer seeing this code, it felt like choosing between the black wire and the red wire to cut if you had a time bomb in front of you:
There was even one time when someone accidentally set production services to connect to ourlatest(dev-stage) Redis instance instead of the correct prod one. It was time to build a tool that would help us move faster and safer.


**Key Points:**

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

- First, a developer pushes changes to a repo (call it Service X).

- Automated regional rollouts, powered by StatsigRelease Pipelines

- Shadow pipeline simulations

- Cost-based VM selection automation

- Highly manual configuration

- Disconnected dependencies

### 12. Simulating Bigtable in BigQuery with Type 2 SCD modeling

**Date:** 2025-05-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Example: For example, “How does user behavior on our app change before, during, and after they obtain a premium subscription?”
We also need to store these updates in aversioned mannersince customers often want to observe how user behavior changes over time or with different properties. Bigtable’s write path also comfortably sustains millions of QPS, so cross‑region replication keeps read latency below 10 ms no matter wherever the request originates, letting us replicate it in near real-time.


**Key Points:**

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- User-property updates are generated in one of two ways (in blue). Customers either set up bulk uploads in our web console, or they use our SDKS to log them at run-time.

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

- Then, we have a Dataflow that reads those updates from Bigtable CDC, and streams those to BigQuery in near real-time.

- The current state of the Bigtable:

- The state of the Bigtable at some moment in time:

- How some property has changed over time:

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

### 13. Chasing metrics, not tasks: Why outcome-obsessed PMs win

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. One of my focus areas was improving our customer acquisition funnel.


**Key Points:**

- Misaligned incentives:Measuring success by task completion rather than outcome impact reinforced a culture of checking boxes rather than driving real business results.

- Letting go of sunk costs:When the data shows an initiative isn’t working, cut it – no matter how much time you’ve invested.

- Zooming out regularly:That metric you’ve been optimizing might not be the one that matters most. Don’t miss the forest for the trees.

- My metrics-focused foundation

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- The roadmap is a false comfort

- The buy-in breakthrough

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 14. Fail faster, learn faster: Why &#34;done&#34; beats &#34;perfect&#34; in modern product management

**Date:** 2025-05-20T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. Shipping thin slices lets you take more at-bats, improve your swing, and learn from each attempt.


**Key Points:**

- Create feedback loops to build learnings from users quickly

- Limit the potential downsides if a feature underperforms and course correct

- Build stakeholder confidence by showing visible progress

- Collect real-world feedback that no amount of planning can substitute for

- Build organizational muscle memory for rapid learning

- Create space for high-risk, high-reward ideas that might be killed in a "perfect first time" culture

- Free up resources to pursue more opportunities rather than polishing a single feature

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

### 15. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. Example: For example, let’s say you true north metric is the revenue generated in the next year. Over time, product changes can improve or degrade the quality of prediction that a particular surrogate model produces.


**Key Points:**

- Inputs should be independent of assignment. Assignment to any given experiment group should be random and not correlated to any input to the predictive model.

- Outputs should not exhibit heteroscedasticity. For each predicted value, the prediction and the expected magnitude of the error term should not be correlated.

- Best Practice for ML Engineering

**Date:** 2025-04-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics.


**Key Points:**

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

- Deployments that must be paused for manual sign‑off orchange‑management windows

- Initialize the Statsig server SDK at the start of your deployment.

- Get deployment decision from feature flags or dynamic configs.

- Deploy the target resources.

- Approve:Manually green‑light the next phase once metrics look good.

- Pause:Hold the rollout at the current phase to gather more data or schedule windows.

### 19. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. But when CVR improves while retention craters, the illusion breaks.


**Key Points:**

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

- Hidden cost of partial coverage:blind spots compound. Teams over‑index on the few things they do measure, and leadership starts believing an incomplete trend line.

- Integrate feature flags and experiments so every featurecanbe a testby default.

- Align engineering KPIs with metrics impact, not feature launch.

- Sunset legacy code that cannot be instrumented; it taxes every future decision.

- Why enterprises struggle:each domain team owns a slice of data; merging them requires cross‑org agreements and latency‑tolerant pipelines.

- Metrics is the language of the company. Make them clear and transparent with a centralized catalog.

- For experiments, pick a couple of primary metrics and a few guardrail metrics. Try to standardize across similar experiments.

### 20. Release pipelines: Safer, staged rollouts across your infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-04-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/release-pipelines


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we believe you can move fastwithoutbreaking things. Your 1% of users could be distributed across hundreds of clusters, and if this change causes unexpected behavior in production, it could bring down your entire infrastructure stack, as every server experiences the increased CPU and memory usage.


**Key Points:**

- Roll out changes environment by environment (dev → staging → prod)

- Target specific infrastructure segments within environments (prod-us-west → prod-us-east → prod-eu)

- Control progression between stages with time intervals or manual approvals

- Monitor each stage before proceeding to the next

- Roll back instantly if issues arise at any stage

- Catch issues early, before they affect a large portion of your infrastructure

- Prevent cascading failuresacross your entire system, ensuring higher uptime

- Validate changes in real production environmentswith minimal risk

### 26. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Example: For example, if you’re trying out a new shipping policy, you can apply it in one state while leaving a similar region as control. ### 3.Phased Rollouts
A phased rollout gradually increases the share of users or clusters that see a new feature (e.g., 1% to 10% to 50%), always using random assignment at each step.


**Key Points:**

- Ensure consistent assignment: If you want a single user to see the same variant as both a buyer and a seller, factor that into your randomization logic.

### 27. What no one tells you about feature flags and messy code

**Date:** 2025-03-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others. Example: Let's walk through an example. For example, if the flag is being used to slowly roll out a new checkout experience, and you're aiming for 100% rollout by the end of the month, create a “Removeff_new_checkout” ticket with a due date 30–45 days after full rollout.


**Key Points:**

- [ ] Remove all `if/else` conditions using `ff_new_checkout`

- [ ] Delete the flag from Statsig’s dashboard (mark as deprecated first)

- [ ] Remove related experiment code or tracking if applicable

- [ ] Update documentation or `FLAGS.md` if needed

- [ ] Confirmation that no users are on the legacy flow

- [ ] No recent rollbacks in the past 14 days

- When should this flag be removed?

- Who’s responsible for removing it?

### 28. KPI traps: How &#34;successful&#34; experiments can still be failures

**Date:** 2025-03-05T00:02-08:00  
**Author:** Lin Jia  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kpi-traps-successful-experiments-can-fail


**Summary:**  
You set up the experiment cautiously, collected data diligently, and celebrated when it achieved statistical significance for your KPI. Example: For example, a company notices that customer service calls are taking too long. When they run a two-week experiment to measure the impact, they find that DAU increases as more users return to the app.


**Key Points:**

- Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever.

- Success on paper, but failure in practice

- False positive risk

- False positive risk given the success rate, p-value threshold of 0.025 (successes only), and 80% power

- How to avoid KPI traps

- Align KPIs with business goals

- Use multiple metrics including high-level objective, user behaviors, and guardrails

- Monitor long-term effects for shipped experiments

### 29. Beyond prompts: A data-driven approach to LLM optimization

**Date:** 2025-03-04T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Anna Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/llm-optimization-online-experimentation


**Summary:**  
This article presents a systematic framework for online A/B testing of LLM applications, focusing onprompt engineering, model selection, and temperature tuning. Example: ## Experiment design and statistical rigor
### Hypothesis and goal
Define a measurable hypothesis: e.g., “Adding an example to the prompt will increase correct answer rates by 5%.” This clarity guides your metrics and success criteria. By isolating and experimenting with specific factors, teams can generate tangible improvements in performance, user engagement, and cost-efficiency.


**Key Points:**

- Improve performance: Validate hypothesis-driven changes (like new prompts) directly with real users.

- Reduce costs: Pinpoint “good enough” model variants or narrower context windows that maintain quality while lowering expenses.

- Boost engagement: Track user behaviors such as conversation length, retention, or click-through rates to ensure AI experiences resonate with users.

- Randomized user allocation: Users are split—often 50/50—so each group experiences only one variant. Randomization ensures a fair comparison.

- Single variable isolation: If testing a new prompt, keep the model and temperature consistent across both variants to attribute outcome differences to prompt changes.

- A different base model (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5).

- A refined prompt with new instructions or examples.

- Altered parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p).

### 30. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Vercel Native Integration

**Date:** 2025-02-27T07:00-12:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-vercel-native-integration


**Summary:**  
Modern web development depends on a seamless experience for users and developers. Performant, fast, and reliable websites are table stakes for users in 2025.At the same time, websites and applications are becoming increasingly complex, with more features, integrations, and components contributing to the user experience. Example: For example, if you're introducing a new navigation layout, you can first enable the flag for internal users, gather feedback, and then gradually roll it out to production—all without pushing a new deployment. No developer wants to manage extra configurations, third-party dashboards, or custom integrations, and no user wants to see a page flicker on load, or experience another 100ms wait until the page renders.


**Key Points:**

- Create and manage feature flagsto control your releases

- Run experimentsto test changes and measure impact

- Gain access to Analytics, Session Replay, and other Statsig product toolsthat don’t exist natively in your Vercel dashboard

- Use Statsig’s SDKs and Edge Config syncingfor low-latency performance without additional setup

- Install the integration:Find Statsig in the Vercel Marketplace and complete the quick setup flow

- Choose a billing plan:Both plans offer generous limits: theFree tierincludes 2M events/month, while thePro tierprovides 5M events/month for just $150

- Install Statsig and connect your Statsig project: Link your Statsig project to Vercel to sync feature flags, experiments, settings, permissions, etc.

- Initialize with Vercel’s Flags SDK or Statsig's SDK:We recommend using Vercel's Flags SDK for Next.js and SvelteKit projects; use Statsig’s SDK for all other projects

### 35. Settings 2.0: Keeping up with a scaling product

**Date:** 2025-01-29T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Cynthia Xin  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/settings-page-design-2025


**Summary:**  
Over the past few years, Statsig has scaled significantly, adding multiple products and features to our platform. Example: In Settings 1.0, the left-side navigation menu was essentially broken down into "project" and "organization."
If users wanted to edit settings for a feature gate, for example, they needed to remember which settings were considered project settings versus organization settings, often resulting in users having to navigate different tabs just to track down one toggle. ### UI simplification
We updated the UI in Settings 2.0 to improve usability while adhering toour latest design system, Pluto.


**Key Points:**

- Members > Select a Team > Edit Team Settings

- Organization Info > Gate Settings

- Settings 2.0 introduces a main navigation and a sub-navigation

- Users can easily switch between Team, Project, and Organization settings for product features by using the sub-navigation

- We recently embarked on a journey to make our Settings page even better.

- Intuitive navigation (Product first, permission level second)

- Consolidating members, teams, and roles

- UI simplification

### 36. The ultimate guide to building an internal feature flagging system

**Date:** 2025-01-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
“Why do people pay for this?”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions. Example: You’re also likely to find some synergies in the code you write across these two services - for example, the service that provides evaluated flag values to clients can borrow logic from the code that evaluates rulesets on your servers, provided they’re written in the same language. - Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?


**Key Points:**

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

- Handle targeting on any user trait, like app version, country, IP address, etc.?

- Have extremely high uptime?

- test a feature in production (by “gating” it to only employees/ beta testers)

- rollout a feature to only certain geographies (by “gating” on user countries)

- run an A/B test (by gating a feature to a random 50% of userIDs)

- Or Run acanary release(release a feature to a random 10% of userIDs, to check that it doesn’t break anything)

### 37. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. Example: For example, if most control exposures come from the US while the test group is evenly split between EU and US, the issue might be linked to the SDK in the EU release. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users.


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Why it’s important

- Our new debugging capabilities

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, if most control exposures come from the US while the test group is evenly split between EU and US, the issue might be linked to the SDK in the EU release.

- For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users.

**Date:** 2025-01-01T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-secret-thread-between-d2c-companies


**Summary:**  
What makes some direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands stand out in crowded markets while others struggle to keep customers engaged? “We used feature flags when introducing voice-ordering in our app… We increased the rollout slowly and analyzed user behavior.”
– Wyatt Thompson, Dollar Shave Club
## How experimentation delivers substantial gains

### 40. When allocation point and exposure point differ

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/when-allocation-point-and-exposure-point-differ


**Summary:**  
Since this feature isn’t visible when the page loads, users in the test group might leave before scrolling down to see it. Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not. If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.


**Key Points:**

- Why does it happen?

- Why does it matter?

- What should you do?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not.

- If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.

### 42. You don&#39;t need large sample sizes to run A/B tests

**Date:** 2024-12-12T03:15+00:00  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/you-dont-need-large-sample-sizes-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Yet many small and medium-sized companies aren’t running A/B Tests. Example: Google routinely runs large search tests on a massive scale, for example 100,000,000 users where a+0.1% effect on topline metrics is a big win. A/B testing is a pillar of data-driven product development irrespective of the product’s size
### Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing
Startup companies have a major advantage in experimentation:huge potential and upside.Startups don’t play the micro-optimization game; they don’t care about a +0.2% increase in click-through rates.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED(Controlled Experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) leverages historical metrics to reduce noise and refine your estimates.

- Stratified Samplingensures balanced and reliable comparisons across small, skewed user segments.

- Differential Impactcan reveal directional and qualitative findings, providing a little more color to the results of your experiment.

- Small companies’ secret advantage in experimentation

- Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing

- Bayesian A/B test calculator

- Google vs a startup: Who has more statistical power?

- Big effects are seldom obvious

In the past year, AI has gone from interesting to impactful. While people had built AI applications prior to 2024, there were few that had achieved massive scale. Example: Here’s an example of a dynamic config:
Once you’ve created this client, calling a model in code is easy. Once this is implemented, all you need to do to adjust the configuration of your model is to change the value of your dynamic config in Statsig.Once the change to the config is made, it will be live in any target applications in ~10 seconds!


**Key Points:**

- Configure your Azure AI modelsfrom a single pane of glass

- Implement Azure AI models in codeusing a simple, lightweight framework

- Automatically collect a variety of metricson model & application performance

- Run powerful A/B tests and experimentsto optimize your AI application

- Compute the results of all tests automatically- with no additional work required

- They provide a layer of abstraction from direct Azure AI API calls, letting you store API parameters in a config and change them dynamically (rather than making code changes)

- They give you a simplified framework for implementing Azure AI models in code

- Targeting releases to internal users to test changes in your production environment

### 46. How A/B testing platforms make data science more interesting

**Date:** 2024-10-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-ab-testing-platforms-make-data-science-more-interesting


**Summary:**  
A/B testing platforms have become highly efficient, automating much of the mundane work involved in setting up, calculating, and reporting on experiments. Example: "An engineer that improves server performance by ten milliseconds more than pays for his or her fully loaded annual costs."
Illustrating the tangible impact of small improvements, Kohavi shared this powerful example. ## Excerpts
"Most experiments fail to improve the metrics they were designed to improve."
Kohavi highlighted a counterintuitive reality: the majority of experiments don't yield the expected positive results.


**Key Points:**

- What’s the current state of experimentation automation since the release of the Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (the "Hippo" book)?

- How does this automation impact the role of data scientists?

- What should data scientists focus on moving forward?

- How can we secure leadership buy-in for experimentation efforts?

### 59. Technical insights to a scalable experimentation system

**Date:** 2024-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/technical-insights-to-a-scalable-experimentation-system


**Summary:**  
(2022)highlighted, establishing trust in experimental results is challenging. Example: For example, a differential baseline between groups prior to a treatment is not statistically biased, but it is undesirable for making business decisions and usually requires resetting the test. In such cases, the cost of maintaining more experiments increases super-linearly, while the benefits increase sub-linearly.


**Key Points:**

- Historical Relevance:Experiments serve both decision-making and learning purposes, requiring a comprehensive understanding of both current and past experiments.

- Managerial incentives often encourage detrimental behaviors, such as p-hacking.

- Experiments may result in technical debt by leaving configurations within the codebase.

- The marginal return of experiments increases linearly or sub-linearly with scale, as less effort is available to turn information into impact.

- The marginal cost of experiments increases super-linearly with scale due to information and managerial overhead.

- Default-on experiments on all new features.

- Define metrics once, use everywhere.

- Reliable, traceable, and transparent data.

### 73. Warehouse Native Year in Review

**Date:** 2024-06-25T12:15-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/warehouse-native-year-in-review


**Summary:**  
Since then, Warehouse Native has grown into a core product for us; we treat it with the same priority as Statsig Cloud, and have developed the two products to share core infrastructure, methodology, and design philosophies. Example: - More tools in the warehouse; for example, we have a beta version ofMetrics Explorerfor warehouse native customers and are excited to continue developing this - sharing a metric definition language between quick metric explorations and advanced statistical calculations helps bridge the gap between exploratory work and rigorous measurement. One of the competitive advantages we think Statsig has is “clock speed” - we just build faster than other teams building the same thing.


**Key Points:**

- Willingness - and internal/external alignment - to ship things that were functional-but-ugly

- Letting the development team play to their strengths

- Treating early customers like team members

- An Engineering “Code Machine” - someone who could crank out quality code twice as fast as other engineers

- A PM “Tech Lead” - someone who leads efforts across the company

- A DS “Product Hybrid” - someone who bridges product and engineering to solve complex business problems

- A year ago, Statsig announced Warehouse Native, bringing our experimentation platform into customers’ Data Warehouses.

- Why warehouse native?

### 78. How to debug your experiments and feature rollouts

**Date:** 2024-05-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-debug-your-experiments-and-feature-rollouts


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a product manager, or a software engineer, you know that even the most meticulously planned test rollout can encounter unexpected hiccups. Example: Statsig also allows you to override specific users, for example, if you wanted to test your feature with employees first in production. Statsig also offersstratified sampling; When experimenting on a user base where a tail-end of power users drive a large portion of an overall metric value, stratified sampling meaningfully reduces false positive rates and makes your results more consistent and trustworthy.


**Key Points:**

- Inadequate sampling: A sample that's too small or not representative of an evenly weighted distribution can lead to inconclusive or misleading results.

- Lack of confidence in metrics: Without trustworthy success metrics, it's harder to determine how to make a decision.

- User exposure issues: If users aren't exposed to the experiment as intended, your data won't reflect their true behavior.

- Biased experiments: Running multiple experiments that affect the same variables can contaminate your results.

- Technical errors: Bugs in the code can introduce unexpected variables that impact the experiment's outcome.

- Success criteria: Before launching an experiment, it's crucial to define how you’re measuring success. Make these metrics readily available for analysis.

- Running experiments mutually exclusively: To prevent experiments from influencing each other, consider using feature flagging frameworks.

- When it comes to digital experimentation and feature rollouts, the devil is often in the details.

### 97. The distinction between experiments and feature flags

**Date:** 2024-03-29T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/distinction-between-experiments-and-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
Feature flagsact as the straightforward gatekeepers of deployment, offering a choice—on or off—for introducing new features. As the quick experiment tool evolved, and its experimental rigor increased which ultimately caused us to lose our ability to create simple A/B tests like Gatekeeper originally allowed.


**Key Points:**

- Feature flags and experiments are indispensable tools in the software-building toolkit—but for different reasons.

- Feature flags, for shipping decisively

- Experiments, for seeking understanding

- The distinction between the two

- The benefits of a unified platform

- Centralized analysis and control

- Data consistency and real-time diagnostics

- End-to-end visibility

### 98. Novelty effects: Everything you need to know

**Date:** 2024-03-20T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/novelty-effects


**Summary:**  
Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness. Example: For example, feature level funnel, and feature level retention, can tell us whether users finished using the feature as we intended and whether they come back to the feature. Imagine this – the restaurant you pass by every day had a 100% improvement on their menu, their chef and their services.


**Key Points:**

- Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness.

- Not all products have novelty effects. They exist mostly in high-frequency products.

- Ignoring the temporary nature of novelty effects may lead to incorrect product decisions, and worse, bad culture.

- The most effective way to find novelty effects and control them is to examinethe time series of treatment effects.

- The root cause solution is to use a set of metrics that correctly represent user intents.

- When understood and used correctly, novelty effects can help you.

- Novelty effects are part of the treatment effects, so there is no statistical method to detect them generically

- Novelty effects are dangerous and will spread if you don’t combat them

### 99. How much does a product analytics platform cost?

**Date:** 2024-03-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-much-does-a-product-analytics-platform-cost


**Summary:**  
Pricing for analytics is rarely transparent. Example: For example, Amplitude Plus comes with Feature Flags, CDP capabilities, and Session Replay.


**Key Points:**

- Amplitude Growth starts in the middle of the pack but spikes around 10M events / month (when our model means a customer crosses 200K MTUs).

- Statsig is consistently the least expensive throughout the curve. In case you think we’re biased, pleasecheck our work!

- When you’re buying a product analytics platform, it’s hard to know if you’re getting good value.

- Assumptions about pricing

- Other things to consider

- Closing thoughts

- Introducing Product Analytics

- Example: For example, Amplitude Plus comes with Feature Flags, CDP capabilities, and Session Replay.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/evaluate-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
Vitamin products make you better over time, but they don’t solve an acute problem right away.For many companies, experimentation platforms can feel like a vitamin product. Example: For example, if you're migrating from LaunchDarkly, you can take advantage of Statsig'smigration toolthat lets you port your feature flags in under 5 minutes! Experimentation platforms also fix other acute pain points, including:
- Giving teams a single source of truth for key product & growth metrics

### 107. Online experimentation: The new paradigm for building AI applications

**Date:** 2023-04-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Palak Goel and Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-products-require-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:
First, product managers would come up with a new idea for a product and lay out a release timeline. Example: But the risks are palpable—for every AI success story, there’s an example of a biased model sharing misinformation, or a feature being pulled due to safety concerns. #### In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today.


**Key Points:**

- How can you launch and iterate on features quickly without compromising your existing user experience?

- How can you move fast while ensuring your apps are safe and reliable?

- How can you ensure that the features you launch lead to substantive, differentiated improvements in user outcomes?

- How can you identify the optimal prompts and models for your specific use case?

- Build compelling AI features that engage users

- Flight dozens of models, prompts and parameters in the ‘back end’ of these features

- Collect data on all inputs and outputs

- Use this data to select the best-performing variant and fine-tune new models

**Author:** Geunbae &#34;GB&#34; Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-importance-of-design-in-b2b-saas


**Summary:**  
The expectations of a delightful user experience—previously reserved for the realm of B2C products—have bled into B2B space as well, with enterprise customers expecting to be delighted by the look and feel of the products that they’re using. Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.


**Key Points:**

- A well-designed product is a strong foundation

- A well-designed product is your value prop, an edge vs. competitors

- A well-designed product helps your team to move faster

- A well-designed product is key in establishing your brand

- Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.

**Date:** 2022-09-15T00:00-04:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-with-your-warehouse


**Summary:**  
This makes it so that you can use your existing events and metrics with Statsig’s experimentation engine. Based on the previous pain points, we built the new approach with the following goals in mind:
- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started
Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started
- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
- Keep things consistent: We’ll treat your imported data just the same as SDK data, materializing into experiment results, creating tracking datasets, and eventually allowing you to explore it in tools like Events Explorer.


**Key Points:**

- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started

- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig

- In your Statsig metrics page, you’ll be able to find the new “Ingestions” tab

- Here, you can give us connection information for one of the supported data warehouses

- You’ll give us a SQL snippet that provides a view for your base metric or event data. This can be as simple as aSELECT *from your existing table!

- In the console, you’ll be able to map your existing fields into Statsig fields

- Once that’s done you can preview the data we’ll pull, set an ingestion schedule, and optionally load some recent historical data to get started.

- Running a scheduled pull and processing your data on your chosen schedule

### 112. CUPED on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-07-07T21:55:42.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics. Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).


**Key Points:**

- The more stable a metric tends to be for the same user over time, the more CUPED can reduce variance and pre-experiment bias

- CUPED utilizespre-exposuredata for users, so experiments on new users or newly logged metrics won’t be able to leverage this technique

- Getting in the habit of setting up key metrics and starting to track metrics before an experiment starts will help you to get the most out of CUPED on Statsig

- Run experiments with more speed and accuracy

- How this will help you

- Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).

- Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics.

### 114. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
They’re trying several ideas at any given time. If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.


**Key Points:**

- Have a clear set of questions the holdout is designed to answer. This will guide your design, holdout duration, value you get and will dictate what costs make sense to incur.

- Understand the costs associated with holdouts. Make sure teams that will pay those costs understand holdout goals and buy in.

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Feature Level Holdouts

- Measuring Cumulative Impact

- If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts!) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way. Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.


**Key Points:**

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

- The target population is split randomly for a test, where some get the solution (Test) and some don’t (Control)

- Unrealized Value: Testing to Understand

- Don’t Waste Your Tests: Take Time to Think About The Results

- Parting Thoughts

- Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.

**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in. Example: For example, our JavaScript client SDK is only12kb minified + Gzipped. #### At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

- 1. Serves a single user at a time

- 2. Not in a secure environment, i.e. assume everything is public

- 3. The device is not always connected to the Internet

- 4. Sensitive to binary size, data usage and latency

- 1. Serves many users from one machine

- 2. Each server runs for a long time

**Date:** 2021-09-24T00:26:47.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-conversion-in-e-commerce


**Summary:**  
Today, I want to share an inside look into experimentation at a popular financial services company that offers payment processing services and APIs for e-commerce applications¹. Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience. This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.


**Key Points:**

- How experimentation moves the numbers in a popular payment processing company

- Experimentation is core to product development

- Experimentation with a smaller user base

- Choosing the right metrics

- All in on Experimentation

- Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience.

- This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.

### 126. My Five Favorite Things About Swift

**Date:** 2021-05-11T07:20:26.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/my-five-favorite-things-about-swift


**Summary:**  
I started doing iOS development at Facebook, which only used Objective-C for its iOS apps. Example: For example, instead of concatenating strings like this:
NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;
NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;
NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];
we can now do this:
let firstMsg = “Concatenating strings in Swift “
let secondMsg = “is EAZY”
let fullMsg = firstMsg + secondMsg
### 2. #### Statsigstrives to empower all developers to ship features faster, so naturally one of the first milestones for us was to provide an SDK for iOS development.


**Key Points:**

- optional parameters and labels

- 1. Swift is much more readable

- 2. Swift supports modern language features

- 3. No more header files!

- 4. Some nice quirks that I didn’t know I wanted

- 5. Easy to port to Objective-C

- Example: For example, instead of concatenating strings like this:
NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;
NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;
NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];
we can now do this:
let firstMsg = “Concatenating strings in Swift “
let secondMsg = “is EAZY”
let fullMsg = firstMsg + secondMsg

### 127. RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

**Date:** 2021-05-05T05:41:52.000Z  
**Author:** Rodrigo Roim  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ruid-time-travel-safe-distributed-unique-64-bit-ids-generated-in-rust


**Summary:**  
AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration. - Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.


**Key Points:**

- 41 bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- 14 bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- 9 bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

- Defining a millisecond maximum time travel thresholdMMTTT(sometimes shortened asM2T3).

- Comparing the current generation timestampCtwith the previous generation timestampPt. WhenCt < Ct + MMTTT < Pt, RUIDs are generated withPtas the timestamp.

- Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

- Should you use it?

### 1. Profiling Server Core: How we cut memory usage by 85%

**Date:** 2025-10-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Daniel Loomb  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/profiling-server-core-how-we-cut-memory-usage


**Summary:**  
The goal was simple: optimize a single codebase and see the results across every server SDK. #### Server Core v0.2.0
When we first launched Server Core, we hadn't yet invested the time to improve memory.


**Key Points:**

- Our Legacy Statsig Python SDK at version 0.64.0

- Our Server Core Python SDK at version 0.2.0 (before memory optimizations)

- Our Server Core Python SDK at version 0.9.3 (latest optimizations)

- Strings consumed 56 MB.Repeated values like "idType": "userID" appeared thousands of times.

- Repeated values like "idType": "userID" appeared thousands of times.

- DynamicReturnable objects consumed 69 MB.They were often duplicated across experiments and layers.

- They were often duplicated across experiments and layers.

- Makes cloning cheap (critical for when the SDK logs exposures, where strings can be repeated frequently).

### 2. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong: Navigating multiple comparison corrections in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparison-corrections-in-a-b


**Summary:**  
This occurs when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted simultaneously, whether it’s peeking at the data during the experiment, examining several key performance indicators (KPIs), or analyzing different segments of the population. Example: For example, with an alpha of 5% and 5 tests, you would reject the null hypothesis for p-values lower than 0.01, instead of 0.05. Additionally, strict corrections like Bonferroni significantly reduce statistical power.


**Key Points:**

- Rank all p-values in ascending order.

- For each p-value, calculate 𝑖 / 𝑚 * 𝛼, where i is the rank of the p-value (according to step 1) and m is the total number of tests.

- Find the largest rank (k) for which the p-value is smaller than the value calculated in step 2.

- Reject all hypotheses till rank k.

- 1 control group, drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 12.

- 7 treatment groups, sampled from the same distribution as the control (i.e., no true effect).

- 3 treatment groups, each with a true revenue uplift of 2.5% (mean = 102.5).

- The proportion of significant results among the three treatment groups with true effects.

### 3. 2 Events, 2 Audiences, 2 Tones. 1 Statsig.

**Date:** 2025-10-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jessie Ong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/2-events-1-statsig


**Summary:**  
Behind the scenes of Statsig’s Austin Airport takeover. When two major events, the F1 Grand Prix and EXL 2025, landed back-to-back in Austin, we couldn’t ignore the opportunity. Example: ### Looking Back, and Ahead
What started as an airport ad buyout turned into a case study in creative agility and cross-functional collaboration. It was seeing how we could push our brand creatively in different directions while remaining true to our core: Statsig helps product builders move faster.


**Key Points:**

- Campaign 1: F1 speed meets product speed

- Campaign 2: A different type of precision

- Two Tones, One Brand

- Looking Back, and Ahead

- Example: ### Looking Back, and Ahead
What started as an airport ad buyout turned into a case study in creative agility and cross-functional collaboration.

- It was seeing how we could push our brand creatively in different directions while remaining true to our core: Statsig helps product builders move faster.

### 7. How we created count distinct in Statsig Cloud

**Date:** 2025-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Aamodit Acharya  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-we-created-count-distinct-in-statsig-cloud


**Summary:**  
When I joined Statsig, I spent my first week reading through customer requests. Almost immediately, a pattern jumped out to me. Unique artists in the first 7 days.


**Key Points:**

- Distinct artists listened per user

- Distinct SKUs purchased per user

- Distinct search queries issued per user

- Distinct repositories pushed per user

- Distinct merchants paid per user

- Wed: viewed {A}If you summed daily distincts you would get 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.Merging the three sketches yields {A, B, C}, which is 3.

- I kept the core model in Spark SQL and stored each day’s sketch as a base64 string in Parquet on GCS so it can safely move through BigQuery tables when needed.

- On the Spark side, I decode that field back into a native sketch and continue merges and extraction with the Spark UDFs and helpers.

### 8. Sink, swim, or scale: What startups teach us about launching AI

**Date:** 2025-08-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Alexey Komissarouk  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-startups-lessons-learned


**Summary:**  
About the guest author.Alexey Komissarouk is aGrowth Engineering Advisorwho teachesGrowth Engineering on Reforge. Previously, he was the Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Early users, however, complained they “still didn’t know what to do with this thing.”Notion pivotedfrom “AI writes for you” to “AI improves what you’ve already written,” redesigned starter prompts, and saw usage rise as the mental cost of exploration dropped.


**Key Points:**

- Pre‑negotiate burst capacity with vendors (spot GPUs, secondary clouds, reseller credits) so you scale up within minutes without surprise bills.

- Offer a “happy hour” off‑peak tier that absorbs hobby traffic without harming premium latency.

- Replace blank prompt boxes with role‑based starter chips and one‑click examples that autofill.

- Instrument “prompt redo” and “undo” events as frustration signals; run weekly funnel reviews on them.

- Offer an “explain my last prompt” toggle—turning trial‑and‑error into guided learning.

- When financially viable, start with a flat plan that eliminates mental transaction costs; layer in usage-based overages only once users reach actual ceilings.

- Expose “token burn so far” inside the interface, not tucked away in billing dashboards.

- Run price‑sensitivity experiments onengagedcohorts, not top‑of‑funnel sign‑ups; willingness to pay lags perceived mastery.

### 9. Optimizing cloud compute costs with GKE and compute classes

**Date:** 2025-07-25T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-cloud-compute-costs-with-gke-and-compute-classes


**Summary:**  
Anyone who has optimized cloud compute costs knows that spot nodes can significantly reduce your bill. Example: But we found that node weighting alone has significant limitations:
- Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling
Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling
- Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time
Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time
### Detailed real-world example
To showcase why this is problematic here is a detailed example. ### How do you reduce your cloud compute costs without using a third-party vendor?


**Key Points:**

- Loss of Control: You're entrusting third-party providers with your node management, which could risk disrupting your workflows with opaque algorithms

- Cost: These services can significantly add to your operational expenses

- Kubernetes preferences only affect initial pod placement, not autoscaling

- Autoscaling naturally favors existing available nodes over spinning up new, optimal ones, leading to suboptimal node distribution over time

- Pool A: Cheapest spot nodes, high preemption rate (5% per hour)

- Pool B: Moderately priced spot nodes, lower preemption rate (2% per hour)

- Pool C: Non-spot nodes, most expensive, zero preemption

- Initial State: All workloads run on Pool A (100 nodes).

### 11. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. Example: Another great example is Notion AI, which writes and summarizes within your existing workspace. Keep response time below 200 ms and uptime above 99.9 %, and you’ve passed.


**Key Points:**

- Google's Geminioutperformed GPT-4 on 30 of 32 benchmarksand beat humans on language understanding tests. Once deployed, it suggestedadding glue to pizzato make cheese stick better.

- Perplexity faced lawsuitsforcreating fake news sectionsand falsely attributing content to real publications.

- Note: We recently launched our Evals product that solves this problem - clickhereto learn more

- Monitor success metrics.These metrics become your real quality benchmarks. The easiest way to do this is with product analytics.

- Watch user sessions.Record user interactions to understand the stories behind metrics - why users drop off, where confusion occurs, when they ignore AI suggestions.

- Ship big changes as A/B tests.Do 50/50 rollouts of what you think will be big wins to quantify the impact. This helps your team build intuition for what actually moves the needle.

- Expand.Ship features to larger and larger groups of users, monitoring success metrics and bad outcomes as you go.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

- How to deal with multiple comparisons

- Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.

### 13. Randomization: The ABC’s of A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-06-30T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it? Example: This example underscores the critical importance of random allocation. It may also be influenced by infrastructure constraints (e.g., if the company’s allocation system only supports online assignment) or performance considerations (e.g., offline assignment may reduce runtimes).


**Key Points:**

- (A) Simple Randomization:Randomly assign users into two groups without considering balancing factors.

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

- Simple randomization: just go with the flow

- Seed randomization: Take your best shot

- Stratified randomization: Be a control freak

- ‍Which randomization method should you use?

- 1. Which users are participating in the experiment?

### 14. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift.


**Key Points:**

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

- It is less susceptible to external shocks (holidays, marketing pulses).

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- Use proxies, not your KPIs

- Boost signal and reduce noise with thoughtful statistics

- Covariate adjustment (CUPED & CURE)

### 15. You can have it all: Parallel testing with A/B tests

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel. By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.


**Key Points:**

- Why test in parallel?

- What should you watch out for?

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel.

- By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.

**Author:** Israel Ben Baruch  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/move-forward-the-a-b-testing-mindset-guide


**Summary:**  
Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time. It sharpens your thinking and helps you act faster if your current test fails.


**Key Points:**

- Be obsessed.You check results more than you should. You run through your funnels again and again. Your head swarms with ideas. You’re not crazy, you’re exactly where you should be.

- Organizational culture.Your mindset needs an organization that supports it - one that encourages people to take risks, experiment, and always push forward.

- Professional expertise.CRO is a craft. Find the people, the content, and the companies to learn from. Apply. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. Most importantly: keep evolving.

- Great tools.Use high-quality, reliable measurement and testing platforms. They’re the foundation of effective testing. No compromises.

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

### 17. Experimentation and AI: 4 trends we’re seeing 

**Date:** 2025-06-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. Example: Example: It has become common for chat interface-based apps (like ChatGPT, Vercel V0, Lovable) to experiment with suggested prompts to help users quickly discover and realize value, which subsequently drives engagement and retention.


**Key Points:**

- Good logging on all the product metrics you care about

- The ability to link these metrics to everything you release

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

- Trend 2: More AI code drives the need for quantitative optimization

- Trend 3: Every engineer is a growth engineer

- Trend 4: Product value comes from your unique context

- Closing thoughts: AI is part of every product

### 18. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. Example: For example, if you were a developer seeing this code, it felt like choosing between the black wire and the red wire to cut if you had a time bomb in front of you:
There was even one time when someone accidentally set production services to connect to ourlatest(dev-stage) Redis instance instead of the correct prod one. It was time to build a tool that would help us move faster and safer.


**Key Points:**

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

- First, a developer pushes changes to a repo (call it Service X).

- Automated regional rollouts, powered by StatsigRelease Pipelines

- Shadow pipeline simulations

- Cost-based VM selection automation

- Highly manual configuration

- Disconnected dependencies

### 19. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. Example: For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes.


**Key Points:**

- the number of units in the control group is relatively small, and

- the denominator is relatively noisy (but still statistically distinct from 0)

- \( Z_{\alpha/2} \) is the critical value associated with the desired confidence level

- \( \mathrm{var}(X_C) \) is the variance of the control group metric values

- \( n_C \) is the number of units in the control group

- \( \overline{X_C} \) is the mean of the control group metric values

### 20. Why data and intuition aren&#39;t enemies

**Date:** 2025-05-30T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Laurel Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-data-and-intuition-arent-enemies


**Summary:**  
I’ve always been excited by the power of data storytelling. Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example. Metrics are often consulted only when something breaks, not when there is an opportunity to improve.


**Key Points:**

- Great products come from intuition guided by data, not intuition versus data.

- The uphill battle for metrics adoption

- Reframing the relationship between data and intuition

- The adaptive nature of good metrics

- Moving forward with adaptive taste

- Finding a data-informed culture at Statsig

- Product manager playbook

- Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example.

### 21. Empowering your team is the future of product leadership

**Date:** 2025-05-28T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. Paradoxically,trying to control everything actually reduces your control over what matters most.


**Key Points:**

- Defining outcomes that matter rather than dictating every task

- Providing context about user needs and business priorities

- Creating frameworks that enable autonomous decision-making

- Trusting your engineers to determine the "how" once they understand the "why"

- The challenge of proving value

- The two paths for product leaders

- The brute force PM

- The force-multiplier leader

### 22. Simulating Bigtable in BigQuery with Type 2 SCD modeling

**Date:** 2025-05-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Example: For example, “How does user behavior on our app change before, during, and after they obtain a premium subscription?”
We also need to store these updates in aversioned mannersince customers often want to observe how user behavior changes over time or with different properties. Bigtable’s write path also comfortably sustains millions of QPS, so cross‑region replication keeps read latency below 10 ms no matter wherever the request originates, letting us replicate it in near real-time.


**Key Points:**

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- User-property updates are generated in one of two ways (in blue). Customers either set up bulk uploads in our web console, or they use our SDKS to log them at run-time.

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

- Then, we have a Dataflow that reads those updates from Bigtable CDC, and streams those to BigQuery in near real-time.

- The current state of the Bigtable:

- The state of the Bigtable at some moment in time:

- How some property has changed over time:

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

### 23. Chasing metrics, not tasks: Why outcome-obsessed PMs win

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. One of my focus areas was improving our customer acquisition funnel.


**Key Points:**

- Misaligned incentives:Measuring success by task completion rather than outcome impact reinforced a culture of checking boxes rather than driving real business results.

- Letting go of sunk costs:When the data shows an initiative isn’t working, cut it – no matter how much time you’ve invested.

- Zooming out regularly:That metric you’ve been optimizing might not be the one that matters most. Don’t miss the forest for the trees.

- My metrics-focused foundation

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- The roadmap is a false comfort

- The buy-in breakthrough

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 24. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- How do you interpret the outcome of a non-inferiority test?

- How do you properly integrate non-inferiority tests into your company's A/B testing process?

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

- Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine.

- In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.

### 25. Fail faster, learn faster: Why &#34;done&#34; beats &#34;perfect&#34; in modern product management

**Date:** 2025-05-20T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. Shipping thin slices lets you take more at-bats, improve your swing, and learn from each attempt.


**Key Points:**

- Create feedback loops to build learnings from users quickly

- Limit the potential downsides if a feature underperforms and course correct

- Build stakeholder confidence by showing visible progress

- Collect real-world feedback that no amount of planning can substitute for

- Build organizational muscle memory for rapid learning

- Create space for high-risk, high-reward ideas that might be killed in a "perfect first time" culture

- Free up resources to pursue more opportunities rather than polishing a single feature

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

### 26. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. Example: For example, let’s say you true north metric is the revenue generated in the next year. Over time, product changes can improve or degrade the quality of prediction that a particular surrogate model produces.


**Key Points:**

- Inputs should be independent of assignment. Assignment to any given experiment group should be random and not correlated to any input to the predictive model.

- Outputs should not exhibit heteroscedasticity. For each predicted value, the prediction and the expected magnitude of the error term should not be correlated.

- Best Practice for ML Engineering

- 6 Best Practices for Machine Learning

- Machine Learning Model Evaluation

- Online Experimentation with Surrogate Metrics: Guidelines and a Case Study

**Date:** 2025-05-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.


**Key Points:**

- Control feature releases– Seamlessly roll out features to targeted groups for testing and iteration.

- Measure impact with experimentation– Understand exactly how changes affect user behavior and business outcomes.

- Unify product data– Gain a single source of truth across users, features, and application performance.

### 29. Continuous promotion for infrastructure with Statsig and Pulumi

**Date:** 2025-04-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics.


**Key Points:**

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

- Deployments that must be paused for manual sign‑off orchange‑management windows

- Initialize the Statsig server SDK at the start of your deployment.

- Get deployment decision from feature flags or dynamic configs.

- Deploy the target resources.

- Approve:Manually green‑light the next phase once metrics look good.

- Pause:Hold the rollout at the current phase to gather more data or schedule windows.

### 30. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. But when CVR improves while retention craters, the illusion breaks.


**Key Points:**

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

- Hidden cost of partial coverage:blind spots compound. Teams over‑index on the few things they do measure, and leadership starts believing an incomplete trend line.

- Integrate feature flags and experiments so every featurecanbe a testby default.

- Align engineering KPIs with metrics impact, not feature launch.

- Sunset legacy code that cannot be instrumented; it taxes every future decision.

- Why enterprises struggle:each domain team owns a slice of data; merging them requires cross‑org agreements and latency‑tolerant pipelines.

- Metrics is the language of the company. Make them clear and transparent with a centralized catalog.

- For experiments, pick a couple of primary metrics and a few guardrail metrics. Try to standardize across similar experiments.

### 31. Release pipelines: Safer, staged rollouts across your infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-04-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/release-pipelines


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we believe you can move fastwithoutbreaking things. Your 1% of users could be distributed across hundreds of clusters, and if this change causes unexpected behavior in production, it could bring down your entire infrastructure stack, as every server experiences the increased CPU and memory usage.


**Key Points:**

- Roll out changes environment by environment (dev → staging → prod)

- Target specific infrastructure segments within environments (prod-us-west → prod-us-east → prod-eu)

- Control progression between stages with time intervals or manual approvals

- Monitor each stage before proceeding to the next

- Roll back instantly if issues arise at any stage

- Catch issues early, before they affect a large portion of your infrastructure

- Prevent cascading failuresacross your entire system, ensuring higher uptime

- Validate changes in real production environmentswith minimal risk

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Example: Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:
Figure 3:A P95 performance graph comparing our legacy Node SDK (green) and Node Core SDK (blue) runtime for a gate check. With Rust's memory safety, performance, concurrency, and zero-cost abstractions, the improvements to actual evaluation time have been huge enough to outweigh the binding costs.


**Key Points:**

- pyo3 (Python):Getting started - PyO3 user guide

- napi-rs (Node):Getting started – NAPI-RS

- jni-rs (Java):GitHub - jni-rs/jni-rs: Rust bindings to the Java Native Interface

- ruslter (Elixir):GitHub - rusterlium/rustler: Safe Rust bridge for creating Erlang NIF functions

### 33. The rise of experimentation as the industry standard

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. Example: One notable example is the16-month TV advertising experimentAmazon ran in a few markets, which showed that TV ads delivered only a modest sales bump. In the new model we grow bylearning faster—hundreds of tiny, controlled bets that compound.


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- Experimenting with the length of forms to mitigate user dropoffs

- Using 20% of an email audience to suss out the best email subject line and sending it to the remaining 80%

- Testingvirtually anythingin a focus group

- Implementing customer surveys to gauge reactions to potential upcoming initiatives

- Jeff Bezos on the importance of experimentation

- A booming market for experimentation platforms like Statsig

### 34. Digital marketing attribution models: A tech survey

**Date:** 2025-04-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. Example: Early versions were still rule-based (for example, splitting credit evenly or favoring the first and last touches). MMM emerged in the 1950s (though it rose to popularity in the 1980s) as a top-down approach that uses aggregate data and statistical regression to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel to sales [1].


**Key Points:**

- Shapley Value Attribution

- Algorithmic/Statistical Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ML)

- Incrementality Testing and Lift Models

- Causal Inference-Based Multi-Channel Attribution

- Customer Journey-based Deep Learning Models

- Captures sequential nature of journeys.

- Explains results via the “If we remove channel X, how many conversions are lost?” logic, which is intuitive.

- More nuanced than any single-position rule; channels that primarily appear in converting paths get more credit.

### 36. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Example: For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:
On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of. We also have tools likeCUPEDthat will control for values that we can see before the experiment, avoiding the worst of the bias and making your experiments run faster.


**Key Points:**

- You have to choose experiments that can be applied across pages, and that you'd expect to have a similar impact on each of the pages you'd apply it to.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

- Image optimizations,such as enabling lazy loading across all pages.

- Multimedia enhancements,like adding audio versions of blog posts to see if this boosts engagement or traffic.

- Challenges of SEO A/B testing

- Designing your experiment

- Sidecar no-code A/B testing

- The right tools for the job

### 37. How to accurately test statistical significance

**Date:** 2025-04-12T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/steps-to-accurately-test-statistical-significance


**Summary:**  
This is where the concept of statistical significance comes into play, helping you make confident choices based on solid data. Example: For example, when testing if a new feature increases user engagement, the null hypothesis would be that engagement remains unchanged. For example, when testing if a new feature increases user engagement, the null hypothesis would be that engagement remains unchanged.


**Key Points:**

- Avoid making decisions based on false positives or random noise

- Identify genuine patterns and relationships that can inform strategic choices

- Allocate resources and investments towards initiatives with proven impact

- Minimize the risk of costly mistakes or missed opportunities

- Clearly define your null and alternative hypotheses based on the question you're investigating

- Select an α that balances the risks ofType I and Type II errorsfor your specific context

- Ensure your sample size is adequate to detect meaningful differences at your chosen α

- A p-value does not indicate the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false. It only measures the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis were true.

### 38. Why A/B testing is ultimately qualitative

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-ab-testing-is-ultimately-qualitative


**Summary:**  
People with diverse perspectives have to debate options in a room, weighing pros and cons between multiple (sometimes conflicting) objectives, many of which can't be captured in a single metric.


**Key Points:**

- Start with a purpose: Don’t run experiments without a well-considered hypothesis. Don't just think aboutwhatmetrics will move, think aboutwhythey might move.

- Invite broader feedback: Listen to stakeholders who might have non-quantitative insights. They may spot factors that algorithms or dashboards might miss.

- Frame decisions as trade-offs: A/B tests often reveal gains in one metric at the expense of another. Bring in qualitative judgments about which trade-offs matter most.

- Understanding the bigger picture

- The limitations of data and the role of expert judgment

- A balanced approach: Numbers and narrative

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

### 39. Introducing CURE: Smarter regression, faster experiments

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/announcing-cure


**Summary:**  
Statsig is excited to announce that we’re moving out of beta testing and into full production launch for CURE - an extension of CUPED - which allows users to add arbitrary covariate data to regression adjustment in their experiments, reducing variance even further than existing CUPED implementations. Example: For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results. For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED: Controlled [Experiment] Using Pre-Experiment Data

- CURE: [Variance] Control Using Regression Estimates

- If you have a predictive model of future behaviors, you can easilyuse that as a covariate in CURE(like Doordash’s CUPAC)

- If you want to provide additional signal to the standard CUPAC approach, you canpick and choose different user attributes or behaviorsto add to the regression

- CURE brings powerful, flexible regression adjustment to every Statsig experiment.

### 44. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. Example: For example, a treatment’s impact on revenue might be most noticeable among high-spending players, where behavioral changes are more pronounced. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects.


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type II error (β):The probability of failing to detect a true improvement when one exists.

- Set the winsorization threshold (X%):In A/B testing, common choices are 1% or 0.1%, depending on the required adjustment and sample size.

- Replace extreme values:Values beyond these thresholds are capped at the corresponding percentile values.

- Why outliers can be harmful

- How to identify outliers

- What to do with outliers

- Time for winsorization!

### 46. Designing controlled experiments to test correlated metrics

**Date:** 2025-03-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/designing-controlled-experiments-correlated-metrics


**Summary:**  
Correlationoccurs when there is a relationship between the values of some variable with the values of some other bariable. total spend in the first 7 days a user is active may be predictive of total spend in the following 6 months
Surrogate metrics, metrics that are a leading indicator or another metric - e.g.


**Key Points:**

### 47. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Example: For example, if you’re trying out a new shipping policy, you can apply it in one state while leaving a similar region as control. ### 3.Phased Rollouts
A phased rollout gradually increases the share of users or clusters that see a new feature (e.g., 1% to 10% to 50%), always using random assignment at each step.


**Key Points:**

- Ensure consistent assignment: If you want a single user to see the same variant as both a buyer and a seller, factor that into your randomization logic.

### 48. What no one tells you about feature flags and messy code

**Date:** 2025-03-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others. Example: Let's walk through an example. For example, if the flag is being used to slowly roll out a new checkout experience, and you're aiming for 100% rollout by the end of the month, create a “Removeff_new_checkout” ticket with a due date 30–45 days after full rollout.


**Key Points:**

- [ ] Remove all `if/else` conditions using `ff_new_checkout`

- [ ] Delete the flag from Statsig’s dashboard (mark as deprecated first)

- [ ] Remove related experiment code or tracking if applicable

- [ ] Update documentation or `FLAGS.md` if needed

- [ ] Confirmation that no users are on the legacy flow

- [ ] No recent rollbacks in the past 14 days

- When should this flag be removed?

- Who’s responsible for removing it?

### 49. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. - Tightening the Confidence (Credible) Interval:Alternatively, one can choose a narrower prior that reduces uncertainty in the posterior distribution.


**Key Points:**

- The choice of priors can strongly influence the resulting posterior estimates, requiring careful calibration to avoid unintentionally skewing the analysis.

- Neither type of informed Bayesian approach is “wrong” in principle, but the first introduces a greater risk of data manipulation, while the second can slow down decision-making.

- In many cases, the second approach is effectively equivalent to applying FDR-type frequentist adjustments and often yields the same outcomes, just framed in Bayesian terms.

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

### 51. Why buying an experimentation platform makes more sense than building one

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/buying-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
“Building your own experimentation platform made a lot of sense… five years ago,” says our customer Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager - Core ML at Whatnot, who previously worked on DoorDash’s in-house platform. Example: For example, over the past year we’ve shipped several advanced capabilities that you won’t find in a typical experimentation platform:
- Stats methodologies such as stratified sampling, differential impact detection, interaction detection, Benjamini Hochberg procedure etc. Over the past few years, several companies have moved away from in-house experimentation tooling and turned to Statsig to scale their experimentation cultures.Notionincreased their experimentation velocity by 30x within a year.Limewent from limited testing to experimenting on every change before rolling it out.


**Key Points:**

- Server & client-side SDKsfor seamless experimentation across all surfaces without impacting performance

- Data logging, ingestion and processing servicesand/or integration with your data warehouse

- Randomization functionsfor accurate user allocations in different scenarios

- Experiment result computationsincluding metric lifts, p-values, confidence intervals, and other statistical calculations

- Automated checks(like power analysis, balanced exposures) to ensure experiments are properly set up and issues are identified proactively

- Statistical correctionsto account for outliers, pre-experimental bias, and differential impact, etc. to provide trustworthy results

- Variance reduction(CUPED, winsorization)

- Experimentation techniqueslike sequential testing, switchback testing, geo-based tests etc.

**Date:** 2025-03-06T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/automating-bigquery-load-jobs-gcs


**Summary:**  
As our data needs evolved, we created a flexible and dynamic ingestion solution. Example: Example:
## Orchestrating workflows
We use an orchestrator configured to trigger our Python ingestion script periodically, following a cron-like schedule. Time-based bucketing of files
We organize incoming data into discrete time buckets (e.g., every 1,000 seconds).


**Key Points:**

- Automatically detect and ingest data into new tables dynamically.

- Group files into time-based buckets for organized ingestion.

- Reliably track ingestion jobs, accounting for potential delays in status reporting.

- BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS:for historical job statuses and to identify completed or failed jobs.

- MongoDB:for tracking pending and initiated jobs to mitigate delays in BigQuery's INFORMATION_SCHEMA updates.

- bq_load_source_bucket_name: Indicates the originating bucket for the load job.

- bq_load_dest_table_name: Indicates the destination table for the load job.

- bq_load_bucket_timestamp: Indicates the specific time bucket processed.

### 55. KPI traps: How &#34;successful&#34; experiments can still be failures

**Date:** 2025-03-05T00:02-08:00  
**Author:** Lin Jia  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kpi-traps-successful-experiments-can-fail


**Summary:**  
You set up the experiment cautiously, collected data diligently, and celebrated when it achieved statistical significance for your KPI. Example: For example, a company notices that customer service calls are taking too long. When they run a two-week experiment to measure the impact, they find that DAU increases as more users return to the app.


**Key Points:**

- Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever.

- Success on paper, but failure in practice

- False positive risk

- False positive risk given the success rate, p-value threshold of 0.025 (successes only), and 80% power

- How to avoid KPI traps

- Align KPIs with business goals

- Use multiple metrics including high-level objective, user behaviors, and guardrails

- Monitor long-term effects for shipped experiments

### 58. Beyond prompts: A data-driven approach to LLM optimization

**Date:** 2025-03-04T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Anna Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/llm-optimization-online-experimentation


**Summary:**  
This article presents a systematic framework for online A/B testing of LLM applications, focusing onprompt engineering, model selection, and temperature tuning. Example: ## Experiment design and statistical rigor
### Hypothesis and goal
Define a measurable hypothesis: e.g., “Adding an example to the prompt will increase correct answer rates by 5%.” This clarity guides your metrics and success criteria. By isolating and experimenting with specific factors, teams can generate tangible improvements in performance, user engagement, and cost-efficiency.


**Key Points:**

- Improve performance: Validate hypothesis-driven changes (like new prompts) directly with real users.

- Reduce costs: Pinpoint “good enough” model variants or narrower context windows that maintain quality while lowering expenses.

- Boost engagement: Track user behaviors such as conversation length, retention, or click-through rates to ensure AI experiences resonate with users.

- Randomized user allocation: Users are split—often 50/50—so each group experiences only one variant. Randomization ensures a fair comparison.

- Single variable isolation: If testing a new prompt, keep the model and temperature consistent across both variants to attribute outcome differences to prompt changes.

- A different base model (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5).

- A refined prompt with new instructions or examples.

- Altered parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p).

### 59. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Vercel Native Integration

**Date:** 2025-02-27T07:00-12:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-vercel-native-integration


**Summary:**  
Modern web development depends on a seamless experience for users and developers. Performant, fast, and reliable websites are table stakes for users in 2025.At the same time, websites and applications are becoming increasingly complex, with more features, integrations, and components contributing to the user experience. Example: For example, if you're introducing a new navigation layout, you can first enable the flag for internal users, gather feedback, and then gradually roll it out to production—all without pushing a new deployment. No developer wants to manage extra configurations, third-party dashboards, or custom integrations, and no user wants to see a page flicker on load, or experience another 100ms wait until the page renders.


**Key Points:**

- Create and manage feature flagsto control your releases

- Run experimentsto test changes and measure impact

- Gain access to Analytics, Session Replay, and other Statsig product toolsthat don’t exist natively in your Vercel dashboard

- Use Statsig’s SDKs and Edge Config syncingfor low-latency performance without additional setup

- Install the integration:Find Statsig in the Vercel Marketplace and complete the quick setup flow

- Choose a billing plan:Both plans offer generous limits: theFree tierincludes 2M events/month, while thePro tierprovides 5M events/month for just $150

- Install Statsig and connect your Statsig project: Link your Statsig project to Vercel to sync feature flags, experiments, settings, permissions, etc.

- Initialize with Vercel’s Flags SDK or Statsig's SDK:We recommend using Vercel's Flags SDK for Next.js and SvelteKit projects; use Statsig’s SDK for all other projects

### 60. How to think about the relationship between correlation and causation

**Date:** 2025-02-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/correlation-vs-causation-guide


**Summary:**  
Yet, people still confuse correlation with causation all the time. Example: For example, this upsell that claims “4x” profile views as promised by LinkedIn Premium is definitely more correlation than causation. The trouble starts when people try to lock down a specific metric or target, like the famous claim thatadding more than 10 friends in 7 days is the key to Facebook’s engagement.


**Key Points:**

- Spot most cases of confusionbetween correlation and causation and form a clear idea of where the errors might come from.

- Grasp the essence of causal inference modelsbased on observed data. You’ll see exactly when their assumptions hold and when they don’t.

- Fifteen-year-old children who took the pill grew an average of 3 inches in one year.

- In the same schools, fifteen-year-old children who didnottake the pill grew an average of 2 inches in one year.

- Families with more money can afford the pill and give their kids better nutrition.

- Families who choose the pill care more about healthy growth and use other measures.

- Families who opt for the pill have shorter kids to begin with, so they show more “catch-up” growth.

- Most of us have heard the phrase “correlation isn’t causation.”

### 62. What are guardrail metrics in A/B tests?

**Date:** 2025-02-26T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Michael Makris  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-are-guardrail-metrics-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Your team designed the feature well, you set ambitious business targets, you built the feature well, and designed a solid A/B test to measure the results. Example: For example, if you're testing a new user interface, your primary metric might be the click-through rate on a feature button. While you aim to improve specific aspects of your product through A/B testing, you shouldn’t compromise on the overall system and business health.


**Key Points:**

- Ensuring that gains in one area do not cause losses in another

- Providing a holistic view of the impact of your tests

- Interactions with other features

- Envision the following:

- Introduction to guardrail metrics in A/B testing

- Primary metrics vs. guardrail metrics

- Not just for mistakes

- Real-world examples

### 63. How Statsig uses query-level experiments to speed up Metrics Explorer

**Date:** 2025-02-20T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Nicole Smith  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/query-level-experiments-metrics-explorer


**Summary:**  
Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. However, when we’re making performance improvements to Metrics Explorer queries, we’re less concerned with a stable user experience for experimentation purposes, and more concerned with making them faster in every scenario.


**Key Points:**

- More funnel steps: When there are more funnel steps, the size of the temp table or CTE in question is more likely to be larger.

- Grouping by a field: This tends to make subsequent steps in the query more expensive, so having using a temp table may be more efficient when a group by is in place.

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

- The implementation

- Handling assignment

- Query event telemetry

### 65. Balancing scale, cost, and performance in experimentation systems

**Date:** 2025-02-11T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Pushpendra Nagtode  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/balancing-scale-cost-performance-experimentation-systems


**Summary:**  
Costs can rise quickly due to the merging of user metrics and exposure logging, a critical yet expensive step in A/B testing. This paper presents key observations in designing an elastic and efficient experimentation system (EEES):
- Cost: An analysis of major cost components and effective strategies to reduce costs.


**Key Points:**

- Cost: An analysis of major cost components and effective strategies to reduce costs.

- Design: Separation of metric definitions from logging to maintain log integrity and enable end-to-end data traceability.

- Technologies: Our transition from Databricks to Google BigQuery and in-house solutions, including motivations and trade-offs.

- Streaming platform: This platform ingests raw exposures and events, ensuring all incoming data is captured in real-time and stored in a raw data layer for further processing.

- Imports: When users have events stored in their own data warehouses, pipelines import this data into the raw data layer, creating a unified data source.

- A/B testing is easy to start but challenging to scale without a well-designed data platform.

### 66. Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics: Not a big deal?

**Date:** 2025-02-11T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-vs-frequentist-statistics


**Summary:**  
One common area of confusion and heated debate is the difference betweenBayesian and Frequentist approaches. In theory, they offer several advantages:
- Faster, more accurate decision-making
Faster, more accurate decision-making
- The ability to leverage past information
The ability to leverage past information
- A structured way to debate underlying assumptions
A structured way to debate underlying assumptions
Because of these benefits, some advocate for their adoption including data scientists at companies like Amazon and Netflix (ref).


**Key Points:**

- The unknown is fixed:Thetrueaverage height of adults in your city isn't changing while you're analyzing your data. It's a fixed, albeit unknown, number.

- Randomness is in the data:The randomness comes fromwhichpeople you happen to sample. If you repeated your survey many times, you'd get slightly different results each time.

- Frequentists:Focus on the long-run frequency of events. Probability is about how often something would happen if you repeated the experiment many times.

- Bayesians:Focus on the degree of belief or certainty about an unknown. Probability is a measure of how likely something is, given your current knowledge.

- Large samples:When you have a lot of data, Bayesian and Frequentist approaches tend to give very similar results. The data overwhelms any prior beliefs in the Bayesian approach.

- A Frequentist might see if a 95% confidence interval for the difference in conversion rates excludes zero.

- A Bayesian might see if a 95% credible interval for the difference lies entirely above zero.

- In most cases, they'll reach the same conclusion about which version is better.

**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-calculate-statistical-significance


**Summary:**  
You’ve got the data and now you have to analyze the results.


**Key Points:**

- In a two-sided test:There is no difference between A and B, or

- In a one-sided test:B (Test) is not better than A (Control).

### 75. Stratified sampling in A/B Tests

**Date:** 2025-01-28T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/stratified-sampling-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Stratified sampling might just be the tool you need to bring clarity and precision to yourA/B testing efforts. Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison. This approach not only improves the quality of your data but also deepens your understanding of how different segments interact with your product.


**Key Points:**

- Identify key covariates: Look at past data to see which demographics or behaviors link closely with the changes you’re testing.

- Categorize your users: Group them by these identified covariates. This ensures each category is tested.

- Imagine you're running experiments to fine-tune your product, but your results swing wildly in every experiment you run.

- Introduction to stratified sampling in A/B testing

- Designing stratified samples for A/B tests

- Implementing stratified sampling in A/B tests

- Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison.

### 76. The ultimate guide to building an internal feature flagging system

**Date:** 2025-01-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
“Why do people pay for this?”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions. Example: You’re also likely to find some synergies in the code you write across these two services - for example, the service that provides evaluated flag values to clients can borrow logic from the code that evaluates rulesets on your servers, provided they’re written in the same language. - Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?


**Key Points:**

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

- Handle targeting on any user trait, like app version, country, IP address, etc.?

- Have extremely high uptime?

- test a feature in production (by “gating” it to only employees/ beta testers)

- rollout a feature to only certain geographies (by “gating” on user countries)

- run an A/B test (by gating a feature to a random 50% of userIDs)

- Or Run acanary release(release a feature to a random 10% of userIDs, to check that it doesn’t break anything)

### 77. Understanding (and reducing) variance and standard deviation

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:01-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-and-reducing-variance-and-standard-deviation


**Summary:**  
But uncertainty is an inevitability, and it's useful to be able to quantify it. Example: For example, if the standard deviation in our a/b test was close to infinity,anyobservation would be reasonably likely to occur by chance . - If we take a population of 10000 users, split them into even groups, and give half a treatment and half a placebo, we can use standard deviation to evaluate if the treatment did anything.


**Key Points:**

- Assume there is no treatment effect

- Measure our outcome metric

- Calculate the standard deviations of the populations’ metric, and the difference in mean metric values between the two groups

- Calculate the probability of observing that difference in means, given the standard deviation/spread of the population metric

- Variance is the average of squared differences from the mean. For each observation, we subtract the mean, multiply the result by itself, and then add all of those values up

- Standard deviation is the square root of the variance in the population

- Standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of observations

- Variance and standard deviation (MIT lecture)

### 78. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. Example: For example, if most control exposures come from the US while the test group is evenly split between EU and US, the issue might be linked to the SDK in the EU release. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users.


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Why it’s important

- Our new debugging capabilities

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, if most control exposures come from the US while the test group is evenly split between EU and US, the issue might be linked to the SDK in the EU release.

### 79. Detecting interaction effects of concurrent experiments

**Date:** 2025-01-13T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Kane Luo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/interaction-effect-detection


**Summary:**  
To accelerate experimentation, medium to large companies run hundreds of A/B tests simultaneously, aiming to isolate and measure the impact of each change, also known as the "main effect."
However, when multiple tests target the same area of your product, they can influence one another, resulting in either overestimation or underestimation of metric changes. Example: For example, to understand the effect of dark mode without the transition animation, you would compare group C to group A using a standard two-sample t-test. This expands the UI compatibility and aims to improve retention.


**Key Points:**

- Relaunch the same experimentsto a mutually exclusive audience. This is especially useful if you need more statistical power particularly on secondary metrics.

- Conduct manual statistical testsand determine which one of the two features to ship.

- If the interaction is synergistic, you candouble down on the combined experience, by either launching a new test or analyzing group A and D.

- Rework the experienceto make the feature compatible.

- Statsig now offersinteraction effect detectionto uncover the hidden effects of experiments on each other.

- Scenario: Dark mode gone wrong

- How do we diagnose it?

- My experiments are interacting—now what?

### 81. How to report test results

**Date:** 2025-01-02T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-report-test-results


**Summary:**  
Now comes the critical moment—communicating your insights to your company’s stakeholders. Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups. Analysts may prematurely generalize sample results to the population, leading to overly definitive claims such as, “This feature will increase revenue by 10%” or “The conversion rate in the new version improved by 5%.”
How to get it right: When communicating test results, it’s crucial to remember that your data reflects what happens in your sample and may not precisely represent the population.


**Key Points:**

- Secondary KPIs: For secondary KPIs, summarize the results visually or in a table that includes the uplift, the boundaries of the confidence interval, and the p-value.

- 1. Overstating certainty

- 2. Confusing Test Settings with Test Results

- 3. Misinterpreting p-values

- 4. Misinterpreting confidence interval

- 5. Ignoring external validity

- An example: Report of test’s results

- Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups.

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/key-problems-in-d2c-that-experimentation-solves


**Summary:**  
“Half your ideas will fail… you need to verify and tweak your ideas until they actually deliver value for the customer.”
– Wyatt Thompson, Dollar Shave Club
## Why D2C brands face unique challenges
Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands thrive by forging direct relationships with customers—yet this also makes them vulnerable to every friction point along the user journey. Example: For example, small tweaks to the timing or format of promotional emails can reduce churn and encourage repeat purchases within 28 days. keyword-based) or surface trending bundles (“Complete the look”) to see which approach not only increases product visibility but also boosts average order value.


**Key Points:**

- For direct-to-consumer brands, data-driven testing is the real game-changer.

### 85. One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/one-tailed-vs-two-tailed-tests


**Summary:**  
If your answer is no—or if you’re not even sure what this means—then this blog is for you! Example: Reviewing the previous graph can help illustrate this: for example, a result in the left tail might be significant under a two-tailed hypothesis but not under a right one-tailed hypothesis. Note that the purple area is larger for the one-tailed hypothesis, compared to the two-tailed hypothesis:
In practice, to maintain the desired power level, we compensate for the reduced power of a two-tailed hypothesis by increasing the sample size (Increasing sample size raises power, though the mechanics of this can be a topic for a separate article).


**Key Points:**

- One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Hypothesis Testing: Understanding the Difference

- Why does it make a difference?

- How to decide between one-tailed and two-tailed hypothesis?

- Get started now!

### 86. When allocation point and exposure point differ

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/when-allocation-point-and-exposure-point-differ


**Summary:**  
Since this feature isn’t visible when the page loads, users in the test group might leave before scrolling down to see it. Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not. If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.


**Key Points:**

- Why does it happen?

- Why does it matter?

- What should you do?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not.

- If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.

### 88. You don&#39;t need large sample sizes to run A/B tests

**Date:** 2024-12-12T03:15+00:00  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/you-dont-need-large-sample-sizes-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Yet many small and medium-sized companies aren’t running A/B Tests. Example: Google routinely runs large search tests on a massive scale, for example 100,000,000 users where a+0.1% effect on topline metrics is a big win. A/B testing is a pillar of data-driven product development irrespective of the product’s size
### Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing
Startup companies have a major advantage in experimentation:huge potential and upside.Startups don’t play the micro-optimization game; they don’t care about a +0.2% increase in click-through rates.

**Summary:**  
In the past year, AI has gone from interesting to impactful. While people had built AI applications prior to 2024, there were few that had achieved massive scale. Example: Here’s an example of a dynamic config:
Once you’ve created this client, calling a model in code is easy. Once this is implemented, all you need to do to adjust the configuration of your model is to change the value of your dynamic config in Statsig.Once the change to the config is made, it will be live in any target applications in ~10 seconds!


**Key Points:**

- Configure your Azure AI modelsfrom a single pane of glass

- Implement Azure AI models in codeusing a simple, lightweight framework

- Automatically collect a variety of metricson model & application performance

- Run powerful A/B tests and experimentsto optimize your AI application

- Compute the results of all tests automatically- with no additional work required

- They provide a layer of abstraction from direct Azure AI API calls, letting you store API parameters in a config and change them dynamically (rather than making code changes)

- They give you a simplified framework for implementing Azure AI models in code

- Targeting releases to internal users to test changes in your production environment

### 93. It’s normal not to be normal(ly distributed): what to do when data is not normally distributed

**Date:** 2024-10-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-to-do-when-data-is-not-normally-distributed


**Summary:**  
Gosset wanted to estimate the quality of the company’s beer, but was concerned that existing statistical methods would be unreliable due to a small sample size. Example: A familiar example is election polling: statisticians want to predict the outcome for all voters but must rely on a sample of survey responses. Key statistical principles, such as the Central Limit Theorem and Slutsky’s Theorem, show that as the sample size increases, the t statistic converges toward a normal distribution.


**Key Points:**

- Normal distribution: the KPI follows a normal distribution.

- Non-normal distribution: the KPI has a non-normal distribution.

- William Sealy Gosset, a former Head Brewer at Guinness Brewery, had a problem.

- Why do we need the normality assumption?

- The normality assumption with large sample sizes

- So, t-test it is?

- Example: A familiar example is election polling: statisticians want to predict the outcome for all voters but must rely on a sample of survey responses.

- Key statistical principles, such as the Central Limit Theorem and Slutsky’s Theorem, show that as the sample size increases, the t statistic converges toward a normal distribution.

### 96. Feature rollouts: How Instagram left me behind

**Date:** 2024-10-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-rollouts-examples


**Summary:**  
Instagram was becoming the primary medium for keeping tabs on friends and influencers alike—perceiving the world through their iPhone lenses, in a way. Example: Take Spotify Wrapped, for example. I’m not sure if it was always meant to be a temporary feature, or if it simply didn’t increase the metrics that Meta had hoped.


**Key Points:**

- Just got fired from my job:Thankful🌸

- Looking for carpenter recommendations:Thankful🌸

- A compilation of Mark Zuckerberg talking about barbecue sauce:Thankful🌸

- This thankful react thing needs to stop:Thankful🌸

### 97. How A/B testing platforms make data science more interesting

**Date:** 2024-10-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-ab-testing-platforms-make-data-science-more-interesting


**Summary:**  
A/B testing platforms have become highly efficient, automating much of the mundane work involved in setting up, calculating, and reporting on experiments. Example: "An engineer that improves server performance by ten milliseconds more than pays for his or her fully loaded annual costs."
Illustrating the tangible impact of small improvements, Kohavi shared this powerful example. ## Excerpts
"Most experiments fail to improve the metrics they were designed to improve."
Kohavi highlighted a counterintuitive reality: the majority of experiments don't yield the expected positive results.


**Key Points:**

- What’s the current state of experimentation automation since the release of the Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (the "Hippo" book)?

- How does this automation impact the role of data scientists?

- What should data scientists focus on moving forward?

- How can we secure leadership buy-in for experimentation efforts?

- Over the past few years, the data science landscape has fundamentally changed.

- My questions to Ronny:

- Three takeaways

- Experimentation automation benefits data scientists both directly and indirectly

**Date:** 2024-10-09T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimental-meta-analysis-and-knowledge-base


**Summary:**  
Over the past three years, we’ve seen several companies significantly scale their experimentation culture, often increasing their experimentation velocity by 10-30x within a year. Example: For example, if you’ve spent a quarter testing ways to optimize product recommendations in your e-commerce app, an individual experiment might guide a ship decision. Whatnot hit a run rate of 400 experiments last year,Notion scaled from single-digit to hundreds per quarter,Rec Room went from nearly zero to 150 experimentsin their first year with Statsig, andLime started testing every change they roll out.


**Key Points:**

- What experiments are running now?

- When are they expected to end?

- What % of experiments ship Control vs Test?

- What is the typical duration?

- Do experiments run for their planned duration or much longer or shorter?

- Do experiments impact key business metrics or only shallow or team-level metrics?

- How much do they impact key business metrics?

- The value of experimentation compounds as you run more experiments.

### 105. Why you should &#34;accept&#34; the null hypothesis when hypothesis testing

**Date:** 2024-09-25T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-accept-null


**Summary:**  
You can only fail to reject it!” is widely circulated but fundamentally flawed.


**Key Points:**

- Many people mistakenly interpret "accepting" the null as "proving" it, which is incorrect.

- Null and alternative hypotheses treated symmetrically:Both (H_0) and (H_1) are explicitly defined, and tests are designed to decide between them based on the data.

- Fisher:The alternative hypothesis is often implicit or not formally specified. The focus is on assessing evidence against (H_0).

- Neyman-Pearson:The alternative hypothesis ((H_1)) is explicitly defined, and tests are constructed to distinguish between (H_0) and (H_1).

- Fisher:Emphasizes measuring evidence against (H_0) without necessarily making a final decision.

- Neyman-Pearson:Emphasizes making a decision between (H_0) and (H_1), incorporating the long-run frequencies of errors.

- Fisher's Null Hypothesis:A unique, specific hypothesis tested to see if there is significant evidence against it, using p-values as a measure of evidence.

**Date:** 2024-09-23T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/comparing-feature-flag-platform-costs


**Summary:**  
To simplify the process, we’ve put togethera spreadsheet comparing pricing, complete with all the formulas we used and any assumptions we made.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig offers the lowest pricing across all usage levels, with free gates for non-analytics use cases (i.e., if a gate is used for an A/B test).

- Launch Darkly’s cost for client-side SDKs reachesthe highest levels across all platformsafter ~100k MAU.

- PostHog client-side SDK costs stand as the second cheapestacross feature flag platforms while still racking uphundreds of dollars for usage over 1M requests.

- The assumption of 20 sessions per MAU is made on the basis that each active user is assumed to have 20 unique sessions each month.

- One request per session is used, given a standard 1:1 ratio for requests and sessions.

- 20 gates instrumented per MAU made on the assumption of using 20 gates in a given product.

- 50% of gates checked each session is used as a benchmark on the basis of users only triggering half of the gates in a given session.

- One context (client-side users, devices, or organizations that encounter feature flags in a product within a month) per MAU given the close definition of the two.

### 109. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Example: Funnels allow you to measure complex relationships with a higher degree of clarity.For example, you see revenue flatten, but product page views are going up. If you care about improving your checkout flow for products, tracking this data at a session level is more powerful, measuring (successes / tries) instead of (successful users / users who tried)
Consider when a user vs.


**Key Points:**

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- Statistical rigor:Make sure funnel conversions have the delta method applied and have sound practices for ordinal logic.

- Ordered events:For funnels to be really useful, you should be able to specify that users do events in a specific sequence over time.

- Multiple-step funnels:Two-step funnels can be useful, but the ability to add intermediate steps as needed for richer understanding is critical.

- Step-level and overall conversion changes:This is how you can identifywheredrop-offs happen.

- Calculation windows:Being able to specify the maximum duration a user has to finish a funnel is critical to running longer experiments.

### 110. CUPED Explained

**Date:** 2024-09-15T00:00-05:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped


**Summary:**  
MeaningControlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data, CUPED is frequently cited as—and used as—one of the most powerful algorithmic tools for increasing the speed and accuracy of experimentation programs. Example: In the example below, it’s pretty obvious that the difference in the groupsbeforethe test would make the results extremely skewed:
You might note that you can see that the weighted runners’ times went up, and the unweighted runners’ times went down. In this article, we’ll:
- Cover the background of CUPED
Cover the background of CUPED
- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED
- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments
## What CUPED solves:
As an experiment matures and hits its target date for readout, it’s not uncommon to see a result that seems to beonly barelyoutside the range where it would be treated as statistical


**Key Points:**

- Cover the background of CUPED

- Illustrate the core concepts behind CUPED

- Show how you can leverage this tool to run faster and less biased experiments

- The effect size in our T-test (the delta between test and control) is exactly the same as the “test” variable’s coefficient in the OLS regression.

- The standard error for the coefficient is the same as the standard error for our T-test.

- The p-value for the “test” variable coefficient is the same as for our t-test!

- Our p-value goes from 0.116 to 0.000 because of the decreased Standard Error. The result, which was previously not statistically significant, is now clearly significant.

- Multiply the pre-experiment population mean byθand add it to each user’s result

### 111. I want it that way: Building experimentation infrastructure and culture with Ronny Kohavi 

**Date:** 2024-09-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Morgan Scalzo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-experimentation-infrastructure-and-culture-ronny-kohavi


**Summary:**  
We recently hosted a virtual meetup featuring Allon Korem, CEO ofBell, and Ronny Kohavi, awidely respected thought leaderand expert in experimentation. Example: For example, a p-value of 0.01 does not mean there is a 99% chance of success. - Experimentation culture: Establishing an organizational culture that embraces experimentation is vital for continuous growth and improvement.


**Key Points:**

- Case study: Only 12% of 1,000 experiments succeeded, illustrating the harsh reality that many organizations must accept—a high failure rate is normal.

- Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches: They covered the differences between these two statistical approaches and their applications in experimentation.

- A/A tests as best practice: RunningA/A testsis strongly recommended to validate experimentation setups and ensure the reliability of testing infrastructure.

- Asymmetric allocation: This approach can provide advantages to the larger group in an experiment, optimizing for specific outcomes.

- You can always learn something from people with lots of experience.

- Key insights from Ronny Kohavi

- Should every organization aim for "fly" in every category?

- Discussion on failures

### 113. How Meta made me a big-time A/B testing advocate

**Date:** 2024-09-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/meta-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
I wanted to show my data scientist audience how powerful Deltoid is, yet was prohibited from doing so as it’s an internal tool. Example: For example, inan earlier video, I discussed how AB testing shapes the meritocracy and competitive culture at Facebook. We found thatthe white background caused a decrease in click-through rate and conversion rate:It made users feel like they were in a traditional e-commerce experience, rather than browsing for deals.


**Key Points:**

- I recordedStatsig’s first public demoover three years ago.

- Measuring our failure

- Understanding our failure

- The difference a white background can make

- The counterfactual of no A/B testing

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, inan earlier video, I discussed how AB testing shapes the meritocracy and competitive culture at Facebook.

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kayak-aircraft-filter-feature


**Summary:**  
And neither were the passengers of Alaska Airlines flight 1282, whose emergency exit door fell out in January, forcing the pilot of the Boeing 737 Max to conduct an emergency landing. Example: Steve Hafner, the CEO of Kayak, goes on to say, “While the overall fraction of users filtering the 737 remains small, usage increased following the Alaska Airlines incident in January(15x compared to month prior from a low baseline), and it has since decreased until this past week (to 10x compared to Dec 2023).”
## What Kayak did right
This is a great example of companies reacting to user sentiment.

### 116. What is A/B testing and why is it important?

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-is-a-b-testing-and-why-is-it-important


**Summary:**  
Underlying AB testing is the concept of “randomized controlled trials (RCTs).” It is the gold standard in finding causality. Example: Let’s use one quick example, which also illustrates what “random assignment” is and its importance. ## Understanding treatment effect with an example
Suppose I claim that I have a magic pill that costs $100 and can increase the height of high school students by 1 inch over a year.


**Key Points:**

- With randomized assignments, the difference between the treatment group and the control group iscaused by the treatment.

- Test group:1000 students who voluntarily took the pill a year ago. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 62 inches this year.

- Control group:1000 students from the same schools with the same age. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 61 inches this year.

- Claim:We shipped a feature and metrics increased 10%

- Reality:The metrics will increase 10% without the feature, such as shipping a Black Friday banner before Black Friday.

- Claim:We shipped a feature, and users who use the feature saw 10% increase in their metrics

- Reality:The users who self-select into using the feature would see a 10% increase without the feature, such as giving a button to power users(ref: why most aha moments are wrong?)

- Humans are bad at attributions and are subject to lots of biases

### 118. Technical insights to a scalable experimentation system

**Date:** 2024-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/technical-insights-to-a-scalable-experimentation-system


**Summary:**  
(2022)highlighted, establishing trust in experimental results is challenging. Example: For example, a differential baseline between groups prior to a treatment is not statistically biased, but it is undesirable for making business decisions and usually requires resetting the test. In such cases, the cost of maintaining more experiments increases super-linearly, while the benefits increase sub-linearly.


**Key Points:**

- Historical Relevance:Experiments serve both decision-making and learning purposes, requiring a comprehensive understanding of both current and past experiments.

- Managerial incentives often encourage detrimental behaviors, such as p-hacking.

- Experiments may result in technical debt by leaving configurations within the codebase.

- The marginal return of experiments increases linearly or sub-linearly with scale, as less effort is available to turn information into impact.

- The marginal cost of experiments increases super-linearly with scale due to information and managerial overhead.

- Default-on experiments on all new features.

- Define metrics once, use everywhere.

- Reliable, traceable, and transparent data.

### 121. Why the uplift in A/B tests often differs from real-world results

**Date:** 2024-08-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-the-uplift-in-a-b-tests-often-differs-from-real-world


**Summary:**  
This disconnect can be puzzling and disappointing, especially when decisions and expectations are built around these tests. Example: A common example I’ve encountered with clients involves tests that yield inconclusive (non-significant) results. While reducing the significance level can decrease the number of false positives, it would also require longer test durations, which may not always be feasible.


**Key Points:**

- Human bias in analysis and interpretation

- False positives

- Sequential testing and overstated effect sizes

- Novelty effect and user behavior

- External validity and real-world factors

- Limited exposure in testing

- Strategies for mitigating discrepancies

### 123. How to pick metrics that make or break your experiments (including do&#39;s and don&#39;ts)

**Date:** 2024-08-14T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Elizabeth George  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-metrics-that-make-or-break-your-experiments


**Summary:**  
In fact, the wrong metrics can not only mislead your results but can also derail your entire strategy.


**Key Points:**

- Have a razor-sharp focus on one primary behavioral metric and a clearly aligned business metric.

- Anticipate and measure the negative consequences of your changes—because they’re inevitable.

- Use secondary metrics to fill in the gaps in your understanding. Without them, you’re operating in the dark.

- Ensure your experiment has enough power to provide conclusive, reliable results. Anything less is a waste of time.

- Stick with the same business metric for every experiment. If it doesn’t align with your specific goals, it’s irrelevant.

- Overcomplicate your analysis with a laundry list of metrics. Clarity and focus are your allies; distraction is your enemy.

- Over-interpret secondary data. If it’s not part of your primary hypothesis, it’s noise—don’t let it lead you astray.

- Your experiments are only as good as the metrics you choose.

### 124. How to plan test duration when using CUPED

**Date:** 2024-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-plan-test-duration-cuped


**Summary:**  
You understand that failing to plan the test duration can lead to underpowered tests and inflated false positive rates due to peeking. Example: Example:
In reality, we don't know the true values of the variables, so we must estimate them. Recently, you've been introduced toCUPED, an advanced statistical method that reduces KPI variance, resulting in more sensitive tests (lower MDE) or shorter test durations (lower sample size).


**Key Points:**

- Calculate the Non-CUPED Sample Size: Use the regular t-test sample size formula.

- Adjust Sample Size: Reduce the calculated sample size by the factor of \(\rho^2\).

- Suppose the non-CUPED sample size is 1000.

- Historical sampled data shows an estimated Pearson correlation of 0.9 between \(X\) and \(Y\).

- Calculate the variance reduction factor: \(0.9^2 = 0.81\).

- Adjust the sample size: \(1000 \times (1 - 0.81) = 190\).

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-i-saved-my-experiment-from-outliers


**Summary:**  
This is why health checks are acriticalpart of an experimentation platform—the more you’re proactively alerted about potential issues, the less likely you are to make a bad ship decision—and worse (in this case), have a bad learning experience.


**Key Points:**

- Change/Add winsorization to manage the influence of these outlier users, or add metric caps to a reasonable number like 5 signup clicks/day

- Use an explore query or qualifying event filter to eliminate these two users from the analysis

- Use an event-user metric instead

### 132. Controlling your type I errors: Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg

**Date:** 2024-07-31T10:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/controlling-type-i-errors-bonferroni-benjamini-hochberg


**Summary:**  
TheBenjamini-Hochberg Procedureis now available on Statsig as a way to reduce your false positives. Example: - FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons
FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons
- FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it
FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it
For each metric evaluation of one variant vs the control, we have:
In any online experiment, we’re likely to have more than just 1 metric and one variant in a given experiment, for example:
We generally recommend the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure as a less severe measure than the Bonferroni Correction, but which still protects you from some amount Type I errors.


**Key Points:**

- (Type I Error) I’m making unnecessary changes that don’t actually improve our product.

- (Type II Error) I missed an opportunity to make our product better because I didn’t detect a difference in my experiment.

- FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons

- FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it

### 133. Hypothesis Testing explained in 4 parts

**Date:** 2024-07-22T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-explained


**Summary:**  
As data scientists, Hypothesis Testing is expected to be well understood, but often not in reality. It is mainly because our textbooks blend two schools of thought – p-value and significance testing vs. Example: For example, some questions are not obvious unless you have thought through them before:
- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis? Third, to illustrate the two concepts concisely, let’s run a visualization by just changing the sample size from 30 to 100 and see how power increases from 86.3% to almost 100%.


**Key Points:**

- Are power or beta dependent on the null hypothesis?

- Can we accept the null hypothesis? Why?

- How does MDE change with alpha holding beta constant?

- Why do we use standard error in Hypothesis Testing but not the standard deviation?

- Why can’t we be specific about the alternative hypothesis so we can properly model it?

- Why is the fundamental tradeoff of the Hypothesis Testing about mistake vs. discovery, not about alpha vs. beta?

- We emphasize a clear distinction between the standard deviation and the standard error, and why the latter is used in Hypothesis Testing

- We explain fully when can you “accept” a hypothesis, when shall you say “failing to reject” instead of “accept”, and why

### 135. Top 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them

**Date:** 2024-07-18T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/top-8-common-experimentation-mistakes-how-to-fix


**Summary:**  
I recently down with Allon Korem, CEO ofBell Statistics, and Tyler VanHaren, Software Engineer at Statsig, to discuss some of the most frequent mistakes companies can make in A/B testing and experimentation! I've summarized the discussion and outlined the 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them. By addressing these common testing mistakes, companies can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of their A/B tests.


**Key Points:**

- Data integrity:Ensure that your allocation point is consistent and verify your distributions using chi-squared tests to detect sample ratio mismatches.

- Skepticism and Vigilance:Regularly check data integrity over different segments and time periods to identify inconsistencies early.

- Proper Metrics:Collaborate with data science teams to ensure metrics are correctly defined and measured, focusing on meaningful business-driven KPIs.

- Statistical Methods:Use t-tests for means and z-tests for proportions in most cases. Ensure your statistical tests are relevant to your hypotheses.

- Peeking:Use sequential testing approaches to manage peeking. Tools like Statsig provide inflated confidence intervals for early data to mitigate premature conclusions.

- Underpowered Tests:Plan tests meticulously using power analysis calculators to ensure you have sufficient data to detect the expected changes.

- Handling Outliers:Use Windsorization to cap extreme values rather than removing outliers entirely, maintaining the integrity of your data.

- Cultural Challenges:Foster a culture that encourages upfront hypothesis formulation and continuous learning from experimentation.

### 136. Introducing Differential Impact Detection 

**Date:** 2024-07-17T09:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/differential-impact-detection


**Summary:**  
Statsig can now automatically surface heterogenous treatment effects across your user properties. In experimentation “one size fits all” is not always true. Example: For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users. For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users.


**Key Points:**

- Investigate the top sub-populations across each user property that you specify as a “Segment of Interest”

- For each primary metric in the experiment, determine if any sub-population has a different response to treatment

- Automatically surface a visualization of metrics sliced by user segments where one or more sub-population behaves significantly differently from the rest of the population

- Apply Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparison (check implementation details at the end)

- Concise Summarization of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Using Total Variation Regularized Regression

- Online Controlled Experiments: Introduction, Pitfalls, and Scaling(see pitfall 6: failing to look at segments)

- What are Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and why do we care?

**Author:** Mike London   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/identifying-experimenting-power-users-statsig


**Summary:**  
For most companies, power users are the driving force behind the success of many digital products, wielding significant influence and engagement compared to the average user. They are not only highly active and skilled with the features of a product, but they also often serve as brand ambassadors, providing valuable feedback and promoting the product within their networks. Example: - For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months. - For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months.


**Key Points:**

- For example,we may measure a power user at Statsig as having created more than 25 experiments within the last 3 months. The data helps you determine the power users. Quantitative.

- For example,at Statsig we have a customer advisory board and are in constant communication with customers via interviews and Slack channels. Qualitative.

- 15 Feature Gates Created in the last month

### 138. How to Ingest Data Into Statsig

**Date:** 2024-07-16T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Logan Bates  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-ingest-data-into-statsig


**Summary:**  
During my endeavors as a data engineer, I’d spend hours helping teams translate data models and building data pipelines between software tools so they could effectively communicate. The frustration of getting the data into tools often spoiled the intended initial experience and added complexities to a production implementation. Event filters can be utilized to reduce downstream event volume to Statsig, so only your relevant metrics are analyzed.


**Key Points:**

- Access to your data source (e.g., data warehouse, 3rd party data tool/CDP, or application code).

- Necessary permissions to read from and write to your data source. (if applicable)

- Familiarity with SQL (if you're using a data warehouse)

- Use thelogEventmethod in various languages to quickly populate Statsig with data for experimentation and analysis

- Log additional metrics alongside 3rd party or internal logging systems to enhance measurement capabilities

- Use in situations where the SDKs are not supported or preferred

- Can be used to support custom metric ingestion workflows

- Quickly populate Statsig with metric data and analyze with themetrics explorer

### 139. Product experimentation best practices

**Date:** 2024-07-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-experimentation-best-practices


**Summary:**  
A good design document eliminates much of the ambiguity and uncertainty often encountered in the analysis and decision-making stages. Example: For example:
- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
### Power analysis, allocation, and duration
Allocation
This is the percentage of the user base that will be eligible for this experiment. These often include:
- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Se


**Key Points:**

- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)

- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)

- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric

- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs

- Running concurrent, mutually exclusive experiments requires allocating a fraction of the user base to each experiment.  On Statsig this is handled withLayers.

- A smaller allocation may be preferable for high-risk experiments, especially when the overall user base is large enough.

- For guardrail metrics: The MDE should be the largest regression size you’re willing to miss and ship unknowingly.

- Use power analysis to determine the duration needed to reach the MDE for each the those primary metrics. If they yield different results, pick the longest one.

### 142. An overview of making early decisions on experiments 

**Date:** 2024-07-05T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Mike London   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/making-early-decisions-on-experiments


**Summary:**  
Online experimentation is becoming more commonplace across all types of businesses today. #### Rewards:
- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.


**Key Points:**

- Noisy data:Early data can be noisy and may not represent the true effect of the experiment, leading to incorrect conclusions (higher likelihood of false positives/false negatives).

- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.

- Resource allocation:Identifying a strong positive or negative trend can help decide whether to continue investing resources in the experiment.

- Select a population: Choose the appropriate population for your experiment. This could be based on a past experiment, a qualifying event, or the entire user base.

- Choose metrics: Input the metrics you plan to use as your evaluation criteria. You can add multiple metrics to analyze sensitivity in your target population.

- Run the power analysis: Provide the above inputs to the tool. Statsig will simulate an experiment, calculating population sizes and variance based on historical behavior.

- Review the readout: Examine the week-by-week simulation results. This will show estimates of the number of users eligible for the experiment each day, derived from historical data.

- It can shrink confidence intervals and p-values, which means that statistically significant results can be achieved with a smaller sample size.

### 143. Understanding significance levels: A key to accurate data analysis

**Date:** 2024-07-03  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-significance-levels-a-key-to-accurate-data-analysis


**Summary:**  
In this post, we provide an introduction to significance levels, what they are, and why they are important for data analysis. Example: For example, let's say you're comparing two versions of a feature using an A/B test. A lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) reduces the risk offalse positivesbut increases the risk of false negatives.


**Key Points:**

- P-values don't measure the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false.

- A statistically significant result doesn't necessarily imply practical significance or importance.

- The significance level (α) is not the probability of making a Type I error (false positive).

- In fields like medicine or aviation, where false positives can have severe consequences, a lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) may be more appropriate.

- For exploratory studies or when false negatives are more problematic, a higher significance level (e.g., 0.10) might be justified.

- P-values don't provide information about themagnitude or practical importanceof an effect.

- Focusing exclusively on p-values can lead to thefile drawer problem, where non-significant results are less likely to be published, creating a biased literature.

- P-values are influenced by sample size; large samples can yield statistically significant results for small, practically unimportant effects.

### 147. Statsig&#39;s Autotune adds contextual bandits for personalization

**Date:** 2024-06-26T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-autotune-contextual-bandits-personalization


**Summary:**  
These contextual bandits are a lightweight form of reinforcement learning that gives teams an easy way to personalize user experiences. Example: For example, a contextual bandit is a great choice to personalize if a user should see “Sports”, “Science”, or “Celebrities” as their top video unit; but it won’t be a good fit for determining which video (with new candidates every day, and with potentially tens of thousands of options) to show them. Running a few tests with Autotune AI can quickly give signal on how much there is to gain from personalizing product surfaces - potentially justifying investing in a dedicated team
## Start measuring your personalization
Hundreds of customers already use Statsig to measure improvements to theirpersonalization program.


**Key Points:**

- Don’t yet have the bandwidth to solve these problems, but want a placeholder for personalization as their teams get more mission-critical parts of their product built

### 156. How to debug your experiments and feature rollouts

**Date:** 2024-05-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-debug-your-experiments-and-feature-rollouts


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a product manager, or a software engineer, you know that even the most meticulously planned test rollout can encounter unexpected hiccups. Example: Statsig also allows you to override specific users, for example, if you wanted to test your feature with employees first in production. Statsig also offersstratified sampling; When experimenting on a user base where a tail-end of power users drive a large portion of an overall metric value, stratified sampling meaningfully reduces false positive rates and makes your results more consistent and trustworthy.


**Key Points:**

- Inadequate sampling: A sample that's too small or not representative of an evenly weighted distribution can lead to inconclusive or misleading results.

- Lack of confidence in metrics: Without trustworthy success metrics, it's harder to determine how to make a decision.

- User exposure issues: If users aren't exposed to the experiment as intended, your data won't reflect their true behavior.

- Biased experiments: Running multiple experiments that affect the same variables can contaminate your results.

- Technical errors: Bugs in the code can introduce unexpected variables that impact the experiment's outcome.

- Success criteria: Before launching an experiment, it's crucial to define how you’re measuring success. Make these metrics readily available for analysis.

- Running experiments mutually exclusively: To prevent experiments from influencing each other, consider using feature flagging frameworks.

- When it comes to digital experimentation and feature rollouts, the devil is often in the details.

### 159. How to track your features&#39; retention

**Date:** 2024-05-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-track-your-features-retention


**Summary:**  
The most common use of retention metrics that you’re familiar with, when A and B are the same action over different time periods T0 and T1, is just a special case of this more generalized definition. Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage. For example, day-of-week seasonality can be aggregated away by setting T0 and T1 to be 7 days in duration and measuring retention on a weekly cadence.


**Key Points:**

- Choosing appropriate A, B, T0, and T1

- The specificity vs sample size trade-off (choosing A)

- When repeated feature usage is more/less meaningful (choosing B)

- Evaluating useful time ranges (choosing T0, T1, and how many retention data points to generate)

- Using Metrics Explorer on Statsig to track feature retention

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage.

**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-experiments-beginners-guide


**Summary:**  
Traditionally, A/B testing has been dominated by Frequentist statistics, which rely on p-values and confidence intervals to make decisions. - Prior information is available: If you have reliable historical data or expert knowledge, Bayesian experiments can use that information to improve the accuracy of the results.


**Key Points:**

- Small sample sizes: When you have limited data, Bayesian methods can be more robust since they can leverage prior information to make up for the lack of data.

- Sequential analysis: Bayesian experiments are well-suited for situations where you want to look at the results continuously and potentially stop the test early.

- Complex models: If you're dealing with complex models or multiple metrics, Bayesian methods can help manage the intricacies more effectively.

- Prior information is available: If you have reliable historical data or expert knowledge, Bayesian experiments can use that information to improve the accuracy of the results.

- Flexibility: Bayesian experiments can be updated continuously as new data comes in, making them well-suited for dynamic environments where conditions change rapidly.

- Clear decision-making: With Bayesian testing, you can quantify the risk associated with a decision, such as the expected loss if a new feature underperforms.

- A Statsig account with access to the experiments feature.

- A clear hypothesis and defined metrics for your experiment.

### 181. The role of confidence levels in statistical analysis

**Date:** 2024-04-04T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/confidence-levels-in-statistical-analysis


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a business analyst, or just someone interested in understanding the nuances of statistical inference, grasping the concept of confidence levels is crucial. Example: For example, a 95% confidence level suggests that if we were to conduct the same study 100 times, we would expect the true parameter to fall within our calculated confidence interval in 95 out of those 100 times.


**Key Points:**

- The sample statistic (e.g., the sample mean)

- The standard error of the statistic

- The desired confidence level

- CI:This stands for "Confidence Interval." It represents the range within which we expect the population mean to lie, given our sample mean and level of confidence.

- Sample Mean: This is the average value of your sample data. It is denoted by the symbol `x̄` (x-bar).

- ±:This symbol indicates that the confidence interval has two bounds: an upper bound and a lower bound.

- What is a confidence level?

- Get more confidence!

### 188. Novelty effects: Everything you need to know

**Date:** 2024-03-20T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/novelty-effects


**Summary:**  
Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness. Example: For example, feature level funnel, and feature level retention, can tell us whether users finished using the feature as we intended and whether they come back to the feature. Imagine this – the restaurant you pass by every day had a 100% improvement on their menu, their chef and their services.


**Key Points:**

- Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness.

- Not all products have novelty effects. They exist mostly in high-frequency products.

- Ignoring the temporary nature of novelty effects may lead to incorrect product decisions, and worse, bad culture.

- The most effective way to find novelty effects and control them is to examinethe time series of treatment effects.

- The root cause solution is to use a set of metrics that correctly represent user intents.

- When understood and used correctly, novelty effects can help you.

- Novelty effects are part of the treatment effects, so there is no statistical method to detect them generically

- Novelty effects are dangerous and will spread if you don’t combat them

### 189. How to monitor the long term effects of your experiment

**Date:** 2024-03-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-monitor-the-long-term-effects-of-your-experiment


**Summary:**  
Now, imagine discovering six months later that it actually reduced long-term retention. Example: Let's get practical with an example from Statsig.


**Key Points:**

- User behavior is unpredictable: Users might initially react positively to a new feature but lose interest over time.

- External factors: Events outside your control, such as a global pandemic, can drastically alter user engagement and skew your experiment results.

- You then model these early signals against historical data of known long-term outcomes. This helps predict the eventual impact on retention.

- It's important to choose surrogate indexes wisely. They must have a proven correlation with the long-term outcome you care about.

- Engaged user biasmeans you're mostly hearing from your power users. They're not your average customer, so their feedback might lead you down a narrow path.

- Selective sampling issuesoccur when you only look at a subset of users. This might make you miss out on broader trends.

- Diversify your data sources: Don't rely solely on one type of user feedback. Look at a mix of both highly engaged users and those less active.

- Use stratified sampling: This means you'll divide your user base into smaller groups or strata based on characteristics like usage frequency. Then, sample evenly from these groups.

### 190. Demystifying identity resolution

**Date:** 2024-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/demystifying-identity-resolution


**Summary:**  
The notion of “identity resolution” in the SaaS world continues to be an elusive gold standard that businesses want to solve in order to understand the full scope of customer behaviors across all touch-points. Example: ## Example ID resolution scenarios
Scenario 1:An unknown user visits the website and gets assigned to the “Test” group fornav_v2experiment using via a deviceID.


**Key Points:**

- No technology providers will solve every use-case and scenario perfectly, though many will make bold claims. There is a ton of nuance here and no one-size-fits-all solution.

- It is strictly impossible to reliably identify a single human interacting anonymously on two different devices that never identify themselves.

- Unknown user identity becomes the crux of the challenge. When switching devices, browsers, environments (server vs. client), or clearing device storage, this ID will not persist.

- The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds.

- A few disclaimers, debunkings, and considerations as we dive in:

- Identity boundary basics

- What does this have to do with experimentation?

- At the Point of assignment

- Amplitude Growth starts in the middle of the pack but spikes around 10M events / month (when our model means a customer crosses 200K MTUs).

- Statsig is consistently the least expensive throughout the curve. In case you think we’re biased, pleasecheck our work!

- When you’re buying a product analytics platform, it’s hard to know if you’re getting good value.

- Assumptions about pricing

- Other things to consider

- Closing thoughts

### 194. Why you should evaluate an experimentation platform sooner rather than later

**Date:** 2024-01-25T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar and Skye Scofield   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/evaluate-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
Vitamin products make you better over time, but they don’t solve an acute problem right away.For many companies, experimentation platforms can feel like a vitamin product. Example: For example, if you're migrating from LaunchDarkly, you can take advantage of Statsig'smigration toolthat lets you port your feature flags in under 5 minutes! Experimentation platforms also fix other acute pain points, including:
- Giving teams a single source of truth for key product & growth metrics

**Key Points:**

- Giving teams a single source of truth for key product & growth metrics

- Lowering the strain on infra and decreasing the chance of data loss

- Reducing the cost (and complexity) associated with maintaining in-house systems

- Missed upside from running experiments (i.e., metric uplifts you didn't see)

- Negative impact from deploying losing features (i.e., metric regressions that you didn't catch)

- Continue adding complexity to your existing processes

- Accumulate more technical debt

- Do you have granular control for flexible, precise targeting of users?

**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ad-blockers-feature-management-testing-tools


**Summary:**  
There are many browser extensions out there today available to web users that help them block pesky ads around the web.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig’s presence on the block lists is less than other providers at the time of writing this, likely due to the fact that we were founded more recently—but this could change!

### 200. Onboarding for growth with A/B tests

**Date:** 2023-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/onboarding-for-growth-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
For B2B SaaS applications, a user’s very first login or download experience has a significant influence on their engagement metrics. Example: Example experiment hypothesis: Tooltip pop-ups at every screen might empower users to progress through the onboarding workflow, thereby increasing the percentage of onboarding completions and subsequently active usage. The quicker you guide them to this revelation (decrease time-to-value), the more likely they are to become sticky, which significantly impacts core metrics such as daily active users (DAU) and ultimately retention and net recurring revenue (NRR).


**Key Points:**

- Incorporating contextual tooltips or pop-ups that empower users to navigate through the workflow (sometimes even including a brief autoplay tutorial)

- Highlighting specific high-value feature(s) that give early wins for users

- Featuring a “one-click quick start” or similar capability that automatically configures basic parameters for immediate use of features

- Offering different plans such as a free trial with limited features vs a premium trial with full access

- Personalizing messaging based on the user's persona such as their industry or role

- Offering discounts in the eleventh hour is not the growth strategy of champions.

- Successful onboarding-for-growth implementations

- Testing and identifying winning features

This is a conversation I have often, and as a result, I have unique insight into what makes a good decision. Compare the functional needs, reliability, scalability, and costs of an in-house solution versus an external service to evaluate which may offer faster innovation.


**Key Points:**

- Build your own in-house platform

- Fork an open-source platform and self-host it

- You’re faced with a dilemma:

- In-house build vs. off-the-shelf solution

**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/notion-how-to-build-an-ai-product


**Summary:**  
Imagine that you’re the CEO of a successful documents company. You know it’s time to build an AI product. Example: With the rate at which the AI space is changing, there will be constant opportunities to improve the AI product by:
- Swapping out models (i.e., replacing GPT-3.5-turbo with GPT-4)
Swapping out models (i.e., replacing GPT-3.5-turbo with GPT-4)
- Creating a new, purpose-built model (i.e., taking an open-source model and training it for your application)

### 203. Online experimentation: The new paradigm for building AI applications

**Date:** 2023-04-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Palak Goel and Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-products-require-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:
First, product managers would come up with a new idea for a product and lay out a release timeline. Example: But the risks are palpable—for every AI success story, there’s an example of a biased model sharing misinformation, or a feature being pulled due to safety concerns. #### In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today.


**Key Points:**

- How can you launch and iterate on features quickly without compromising your existing user experience?

- How can you move fast while ensuring your apps are safe and reliable?

- How can you ensure that the features you launch lead to substantive, differentiated improvements in user outcomes?

- How can you identify the optimal prompts and models for your specific use case?

- Build compelling AI features that engage users

- Flight dozens of models, prompts and parameters in the ‘back end’ of these features

- Collect data on all inputs and outputs

- Use this data to select the best-performing variant and fine-tune new models

**Summary:**  
Within Statsig, we celebrate these increases when they are statistically significant with a deep, satisfying, green color:
## When up isn’t good
But what about when thisisn’tthe case? Example: ## Real-world example: Performance improvement
We ran into a case like this at Statsig when we ran an experiment to load content from the next page when your cursor hovers on the link, since you might visit there imminently.


**Key Points:**

- the count of crashes in your app

- removals of items from a shopping cart

- For most measurements we make in product development, we want the value to go “up and to the right.”

- When up isn’t good

### 207. The Importance of Design in B2B SaaS

**Date:** 2022-09-29T00:00-04:00  
**Author:** Geunbae &#34;GB&#34; Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-importance-of-design-in-b2b-saas


**Summary:**  
The expectations of a delightful user experience—previously reserved for the realm of B2C products—have bled into B2B space as well, with enterprise customers expecting to be delighted by the look and feel of the products that they’re using. Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.


**Key Points:**

- A well-designed product is a strong foundation

- A well-designed product is your value prop, an edge vs. competitors

- A well-designed product helps your team to move faster

- A well-designed product is key in establishing your brand

- Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.

Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
- Keep things consistent: We’ll treat your imported data just the same as SDK data, materializing into experiment results, creating tracking datasets, and eventually allowing you to explore it in tools like Events Explorer.


**Key Points:**

- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started

- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig

- In your Statsig metrics page, you’ll be able to find the new “Ingestions” tab

- Here, you can give us connection information for one of the supported data warehouses

### 210. Understanding the role of the 95% confidence interval

**Date:** 2022-08-04T16:31:57.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/95-percent-confidence-interval


**Summary:**  
Yet its validity and usefulness is often questioned. Example: For example, startup companies that have a high risk tolerance will want to minimize false negatives by selecting lower confidence intervals (e.g., 80% or 90%). I’m a proponent of 95%confidence intervalsand recommend them as a solid default.


**Key Points:**

- A range of plausible values

- An indicator of how repeatable/stable our experimental method is

- It’s a reasonable low bar.In practice, it’s an achievable benchmark for most fields of research to remain productive.

- It’s ubiquitous.It ensures we’re all speaking the same language. What one team within your company considers significant is the same as another team.

- Set your confidence threshold BEFORE any data is collected. Cheaters change the confidence interval after there’s an opportunity to peek.

- Gelman, Andrew (Nov. 5, 2016).“Why I prefer 50% rather than 95% intervals”.

- Gelman, Andrew (Dec 28, 2017).“Stupid-ass statisticians don’t know what a goddam confidence interval is”.

### 212. CUPED on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-07-07T21:55:42.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics. Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).


**Key Points:**

- The more stable a metric tends to be for the same user over time, the more CUPED can reduce variance and pre-experiment bias

- CUPED utilizespre-exposuredata for users, so experiments on new users or newly logged metrics won’t be able to leverage this technique

- Getting in the habit of setting up key metrics and starting to track metrics before an experiment starts will help you to get the most out of CUPED on Statsig

- Run experiments with more speed and accuracy

- How this will help you

- Example: Variance Reduction
In the hypothetical example below, we run an experiment that increases our mean metric value from 4 (control) to 6 (variant).

- Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics.

- Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
- Make it trivial to test a change with a small section of users, and progressively expand the blast radius; for example, start by dog-fooding features with internal employees, then open up to a small group customers, say, who asked for the feature, then expand more broadly

### 215. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
They’re trying several ideas at any given time. If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.


**Key Points:**

- Have a clear set of questions the holdout is designed to answer. This will guide your design, holdout duration, value you get and will dictate what costs make sense to incur.

- Understand the costs associated with holdouts. Make sure teams that will pay those costs understand holdout goals and buy in.

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Feature Level Holdouts

- Measuring Cumulative Impact

- If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts!) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way. Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.


**Key Points:**

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

- The target population is split randomly for a test, where some get the solution (Test) and some don’t (Control)

- Unrealized Value: Testing to Understand

- Don’t Waste Your Tests: Take Time to Think About The Results

- Parting Thoughts

- Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.

### 219. Modernizing the Customer Data Stack

**Date:** 2022-04-18T21:30:15.000Z  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/modernizing-the-customer-data-stack


**Summary:**  
There are two key factors influencing this rapid modernization:
- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.


**Key Points:**

- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.

- Businesses want to leverage rapidly evolving and automated data intelligence inside their customer-facing applications.

- Websites, mobile applications and server side applications.

- If a business is generating calculated metrics, model outputs or cohorts in a warehouse, that ultimately becomes a data producer as well.

- Help desks, payment systems, marketing tools, A/B testing tools, ad platforms, CRMs, etc.

- Too many custom pipelines, SDKs and transformations decrease the fidelity and manageability of data over time.

- It’s impossible to enforce schema standardization across channels without introducing latency (Everyone loves a bolt onMDM… right?).

- It’s impossible to resolve user identities across channels without complex user identity services, which introduce latency.

### 222. Democratizing Experimentation

**Date:** 2022-03-21T05:41:41.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/democratizing-experimentation


**Summary:**  
When building out instant games on Facebook a few years back, a new developer switched to use a newer version of an internal SDK. Example: (once measures turn into goals, it’s possible to incent behavior that’s undesirable unless we’re prudent; see theHanoi Rat Problemfor an interesting example)
Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want? A more experienced teammate noticed the change reduced time spent in the game.


**Key Points:**

- Is the metric movement explainable?

- Are all significant movements being reported, not just the positive ones?

- Are guardrail metrics being violated?

- Is there a quota we’re drawing from?

- Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want?

- Guarding againstp-hacking (or selective reporting)(often by establishing guidelines like using ~14 day windows to report results over;see more about reading results safely here.)

- Amazon famously reduced distractions during checkout flows to improve conversion. This is a pattern that most ecommerce sites now optimize for.

- Experiment Review Best Practices

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/definitive-guide-ecommerce-growth


**Summary:**  
I’ve done it thrice, first with Flipkart, then with a company that I founded myself, then at Amazon. Example: For example, anA/B testfor checkout on the Vancouver Olympic Store showed that a single page checkout performed 21.8% better than the multi-step checkout. Large improvements deeper in the funnel require a smaller sample size to test and make every upstream step more effective.


**Key Points:**

- E-commerce is hard.

- 1. Optimizing Conversion Rate

- Crushing the Gloom of Cart Abandonment

- Lighting-up Add-to-Cart Conversions

### 232. How Statsig Designs SDKs for Different Application Environments

**Date:** 2021-10-22T05:10:07.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in. Example: For example, our JavaScript client SDK is only12kb minified + Gzipped. #### At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

- 1. Serves a single user at a time

- 2. Not in a secure environment, i.e. assume everything is public

- 3. The device is not always connected to the Internet

- 4. Sensitive to binary size, data usage and latency

- 1. Serves many users from one machine

- 2. Each server runs for a long time

- Example: For example, our JavaScript client SDK is only12kb minified + Gzipped.

### 235. Embrace Overlapping A/B Tests and Avoid the Dangers of Isolating Experiments

**Date:** 2021-10-08T06:44:42.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/embracing-overlapping-a-b-tests-and-the-danger-of-isolating-experiments


**Summary:**  
How to handle simultaneous experiments frequently comes up. Example: For example, one cannot test new ranking algorithm A (vs control) and also new ranking algorithm B (vs control) in overlapping tests. This method maintains experimental power, but can reduce accuracy (as I’ll explain later, this is not a major drawback).


**Key Points:**

- Isolated tests— Users are split into segments, and each user is enrolled in only one experiment. Your experimental power is reduced, but accuracy of results are maintained.

- Microsoft’s Online Controlled Experiments At Scale

- How Google Conducts More experiments

- Can You Run Multiple AB Tests At The Same Time?

- Large Scale Experimentation at Spotify

- Running Multiple A/B Tests at The Same Time: Do’s and Dont’s

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ab-testing-for-dummies


**Summary:**  
Since then, my level of understanding has graduated from preschool to elementary- nice! Example: Let me give you an example- for awhile, Facebook was testing out pimple popping videos to engage more folks on video. A/B testing means we can try out more features and quickly see which ones work.Instead of just holding onto one idea and running with it for 6 months, by progressively rolling out new ideas all the time, companies build better products faster.


**Key Points:**

- This is what I googled on my first day with Statsig.

- Example: Let me give you an example- for awhile, Facebook was testing out pimple popping videos to engage more folks on video.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-causal-roundup


**Summary:**  
Covering topics from experimentation to causal inference, theStatsigteam brings to you work from leaders who are building the future of product decision-making. Example: For example, LinkedIn aims to improve its hiring products with a true north metric calledconfirmed hires(CH), which measures members who found jobs using LinkedIn products. — Lincoln
One of the challenges with improving long-term metrics such as engagement is that these metrics are hard to move and often require long drawn-out experiments.


**Key Points:**

- Mind over data at Netflix

- Mind over data📈

- Pursuit of True North 🧭

- ‘Criminally underused in tech’🚨

- Example: For example, LinkedIn aims to improve its hiring products with a true north metric calledconfirmed hires(CH), which measures members who found jobs using LinkedIn products.

### 238. Inside Look: Optimizing Conversion in E-commerce

**Date:** 2021-09-24T00:26:47.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-conversion-in-e-commerce


**Summary:**  
Today, I want to share an inside look into experimentation at a popular financial services company that offers payment processing services and APIs for e-commerce applications¹. Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience. This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.


**Key Points:**

- How experimentation moves the numbers in a popular payment processing company

- Experimentation is core to product development

- Experimentation with a smaller user base

- Choosing the right metrics

- All in on Experimentation

- Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-auth0-nailed-demand-generation


**Summary:**  
Similarly, reducing friction during evaluation means that we enable these leads to get qualified as efficiently as possible. Example: Let’s use a case study to see how a well-oiled demand generation engine works. #### Automating Demand Generation in Three Steps
Product-led Growth (PLG) is magical because it does two things really well:
- It reduces the cost of acquiring leads
It reduces the cost of acquiring leads
- It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product
It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product
Reducing the cost of acquiring leads means that we make lead generation as automated and efficient as possible.


**Key Points:**

- It reduces the cost of acquiring leads

- It reduces friction for prospects evaluating the product

- Automating Demand Generation in Three Steps

- How an enterprise company found Auth0

- Auth0’s Demand Generation Engine

- Step 1: Content Marketing

**Author:** Rodrigo Roim  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ruid-time-travel-safe-distributed-unique-64-bit-ids-generated-in-rust


**Summary:**  
AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration. - Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.


**Key Points:**

- 41 bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- 14 bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- 9 bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

- Defining a millisecond maximum time travel thresholdMMTTT(sometimes shortened asM2T3).

- Comparing the current generation timestampCtwith the previous generation timestampPt. WhenCt < Ct + MMTTT < Pt, RUIDs are generated withPtas the timestamp.

- Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

### 1. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong: Navigating multiple comparison corrections in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparison-corrections-in-a-b


**Summary:**  
This occurs when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted simultaneously, whether it’s peeking at the data during the experiment, examining several key performance indicators (KPIs), or analyzing different segments of the population. Example: For example, with an alpha of 5% and 5 tests, you would reject the null hypothesis for p-values lower than 0.01, instead of 0.05. Additionally, strict corrections like Bonferroni significantly reduce statistical power.


**Key Points:**

- Rank all p-values in ascending order.

- For each p-value, calculate 𝑖 / 𝑚 * 𝛼, where i is the rank of the p-value (according to step 1) and m is the total number of tests.

- Find the largest rank (k) for which the p-value is smaller than the value calculated in step 2.

- Reject all hypotheses till rank k.

- 1 control group, drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 12.

- 7 treatment groups, sampled from the same distribution as the control (i.e., no true effect).

- 3 treatment groups, each with a true revenue uplift of 2.5% (mean = 102.5).

- The proportion of significant results among the three treatment groups with true effects.

### 2. Experiments with AI in the Creative Process

**Date:** 2025-10-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cat Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experiments-with-ai-creative


**Summary:**  
In-house OOH campaigns are rare opportunities to exercise creativity beyond the usual brand tone. They can be tailored to their context - location, audience, event - and reframe a brand's core narrative. Example: (For example, uploading a picture of a pit stop wheel gun would generate something that looked like a hair dryer.)
Even after getting the generated image "close enough," the resolution was low, edges were messy, and details were off. Ultimately we found that using AI helped us increase ourcreative velocity: the speed at which our ideas could become real and move to execution.


**Key Points:**

- Quickly generate images to communicate concepts

- Create numerous copy variations to expand our brainstorms

- Research contextually relevant information

- Clarify your vision first—creative direction is keyThis is the pivotal point in the creative process where you either use AI creatively or let AI be creative for you.

- Use AI to optimize for AIOnce you've set a clear creative direction, refine your language to work with the specific image generation models you're using.

- Early Phase: Concept Development

- Mid Phase: Fleshing out a direction

- Key learnings for prompting

**Date:** 2025-08-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Aamodit Acharya  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-we-created-count-distinct-in-statsig-cloud


**Summary:**  
When I joined Statsig, I spent my first week reading through customer requests. Almost immediately, a pattern jumped out to me. Unique artists in the first 7 days.


**Key Points:**

- Distinct artists listened per user

- Distinct SKUs purchased per user

- Distinct search queries issued per user

- Distinct repositories pushed per user

- Distinct merchants paid per user

- Wed: viewed {A}If you summed daily distincts you would get 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.Merging the three sketches yields {A, B, C}, which is 3.

- I kept the core model in Spark SQL and stored each day’s sketch as a base64 string in Parquet on GCS so it can safely move through BigQuery tables when needed.

- On the Spark side, I decode that field back into a native sketch and continue merges and extraction with the Spark UDFs and helpers.

### 8. Sink, swim, or scale: What startups teach us about launching AI

**Date:** 2025-08-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Alexey Komissarouk  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-startups-lessons-learned


**Summary:**  
About the guest author.Alexey Komissarouk is aGrowth Engineering Advisorwho teachesGrowth Engineering on Reforge. Previously, he was the Head of Growth Engineering at MasterClass. Early users, however, complained they “still didn’t know what to do with this thing.”Notion pivotedfrom “AI writes for you” to “AI improves what you’ve already written,” redesigned starter prompts, and saw usage rise as the mental cost of exploration dropped.


**Key Points:**

- Pre‑negotiate burst capacity with vendors (spot GPUs, secondary clouds, reseller credits) so you scale up within minutes without surprise bills.

- Offer a “happy hour” off‑peak tier that absorbs hobby traffic without harming premium latency.

- Replace blank prompt boxes with role‑based starter chips and one‑click examples that autofill.

- Instrument “prompt redo” and “undo” events as frustration signals; run weekly funnel reviews on them.

- Offer an “explain my last prompt” toggle—turning trial‑and‑error into guided learning.

- When financially viable, start with a flat plan that eliminates mental transaction costs; layer in usage-based overages only once users reach actual ceilings.

- Expose “token burn so far” inside the interface, not tucked away in billing dashboards.

- Run price‑sensitivity experiments onengagedcohorts, not top‑of‑funnel sign‑ups; willingness to pay lags perceived mastery.

### 10. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. Example: Another great example is Notion AI, which writes and summarizes within your existing workspace. Keep response time below 200 ms and uptime above 99.9 %, and you’ve passed.


**Key Points:**

- Google's Geminioutperformed GPT-4 on 30 of 32 benchmarksand beat humans on language understanding tests. Once deployed, it suggestedadding glue to pizzato make cheese stick better.

- Perplexity faced lawsuitsforcreating fake news sectionsand falsely attributing content to real publications.

- Note: We recently launched our Evals product that solves this problem - clickhereto learn more

- Monitor success metrics.These metrics become your real quality benchmarks. The easiest way to do this is with product analytics.

- Watch user sessions.Record user interactions to understand the stories behind metrics - why users drop off, where confusion occurs, when they ignore AI suggestions.

- Ship big changes as A/B tests.Do 50/50 rollouts of what you think will be big wins to quantify the impact. This helps your team build intuition for what actually moves the needle.

- Expand.Ship features to larger and larger groups of users, monitoring success metrics and bad outcomes as you go.

### 11. The more the merrier? The problem of multiple comparisons in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-07-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results? Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

- How to deal with multiple comparisons

- Each additional comparison increases the likelihood of encountering a false positive, also known as Type I error.

### 12. Randomization: The ABC’s of A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-06-30T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it? Example: This example underscores the critical importance of random allocation. It may also be influenced by infrastructure constraints (e.g., if the company’s allocation system only supports online assignment) or performance considerations (e.g., offline assignment may reduce runtimes).


**Key Points:**

- (A) Simple Randomization:Randomly assign users into two groups without considering balancing factors.

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

- Simple randomization: just go with the flow

- Seed randomization: Take your best shot

- Stratified randomization: Be a control freak

- ‍Which randomization method should you use?

- 1. Which users are participating in the experiment?

### 13. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift.


**Key Points:**

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

- It is less susceptible to external shocks (holidays, marketing pulses).

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- Use proxies, not your KPIs

- Boost signal and reduce noise with thoughtful statistics

- Covariate adjustment (CUPED & CURE)


---


### 14. You can have it all: Parallel testing with A/B tests

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel. By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.


**Key Points:**

- Why test in parallel?

- What should you watch out for?

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, if you're testing how color and font size impact revenue, and the real improvement comes from their combination rather than each factor alone, you would only uncover this insight by testing them in parallel.

- By removing the restriction of sequential testing, analysts can significantly increase the pace of A/B testing, enabling faster insights and more efficient product development.

### 15. Move forward: The A/B testing mindset guide

**Date:** 2025-06-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Israel Ben Baruch  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/move-forward-the-a-b-testing-mindset-guide


**Summary:**  
Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time. It sharpens your thinking and helps you act faster if your current test fails.


**Key Points:**

- Be obsessed.You check results more than you should. You run through your funnels again and again. Your head swarms with ideas. You’re not crazy, you’re exactly where you should be.

- Organizational culture.Your mindset needs an organization that supports it - one that encourages people to take risks, experiment, and always push forward.

- Professional expertise.CRO is a craft. Find the people, the content, and the companies to learn from. Apply. Get your hands dirty. Make mistakes. Most importantly: keep evolving.

- Great tools.Use high-quality, reliable measurement and testing platforms. They’re the foundation of effective testing. No compromises.

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

### 16. Experimentation and AI: 4 trends we’re seeing 

**Date:** 2025-06-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. Example: Example: It has become common for chat interface-based apps (like ChatGPT, Vercel V0, Lovable) to experiment with suggested prompts to help users quickly discover and realize value, which subsequently drives engagement and retention.


**Key Points:**

- Good logging on all the product metrics you care about

- The ability to link these metrics to everything you release

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

- Trend 2: More AI code drives the need for quantitative optimization

- Trend 3: Every engineer is a growth engineer

- Trend 4: Product value comes from your unique context

- Closing thoughts: AI is part of every product

### 17. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. Example: For example, if you were a developer seeing this code, it felt like choosing between the black wire and the red wire to cut if you had a time bomb in front of you:
There was even one time when someone accidentally set production services to connect to ourlatest(dev-stage) Redis instance instead of the correct prod one. It was time to build a tool that would help us move faster and safer.


**Key Points:**

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

- First, a developer pushes changes to a repo (call it Service X).

- Automated regional rollouts, powered by StatsigRelease Pipelines

- Shadow pipeline simulations

- Cost-based VM selection automation

- Highly manual configuration

- Disconnected dependencies

### 18. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. Example: For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%."
This is because relative metrics abstract away raw units, which lets you more easily understand the practical impact of product changes.


**Key Points:**

- the number of units in the control group is relatively small, and

- the denominator is relatively noisy (but still statistically distinct from 0)

- \( Z_{\alpha/2} \) is the critical value associated with the desired confidence level

- \( \mathrm{var}(X_C) \) is the variance of the control group metric values

- \( n_C \) is the number of units in the control group

- \( \overline{X_C} \) is the mean of the control group metric values

### 19. Why data and intuition aren&#39;t enemies

**Date:** 2025-05-30T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Laurel Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-data-and-intuition-arent-enemies


**Summary:**  
I’ve always been excited by the power of data storytelling. Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example. Metrics are often consulted only when something breaks, not when there is an opportunity to improve.


**Key Points:**

- Great products come from intuition guided by data, not intuition versus data.

- The uphill battle for metrics adoption

- Reframing the relationship between data and intuition

- The adaptive nature of good metrics

- Moving forward with adaptive taste

- Finding a data-informed culture at Statsig

- Product manager playbook

- Example: Take a dashboard feature, for example.

### 20. Empowering your team is the future of product leadership

**Date:** 2025-05-28T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. Paradoxically,trying to control everything actually reduces your control over what matters most.


**Key Points:**

- Defining outcomes that matter rather than dictating every task

- Providing context about user needs and business priorities

- Creating frameworks that enable autonomous decision-making

- Trusting your engineers to determine the "how" once they understand the "why"

- The challenge of proving value

- The two paths for product leaders

- The brute force PM

- The force-multiplier leader

### 21. Simulating Bigtable in BigQuery with Type 2 SCD modeling

**Date:** 2025-05-27T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Example: For example, “How does user behavior on our app change before, during, and after they obtain a premium subscription?”
We also need to store these updates in aversioned mannersince customers often want to observe how user behavior changes over time or with different properties. Bigtable’s write path also comfortably sustains millions of QPS, so cross‑region replication keeps read latency below 10 ms no matter wherever the request originates, letting us replicate it in near real-time.


**Key Points:**

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- User-property updates are generated in one of two ways (in blue). Customers either set up bulk uploads in our web console, or they use our SDKS to log them at run-time.

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

- Then, we have a Dataflow that reads those updates from Bigtable CDC, and streams those to BigQuery in near real-time.

- The current state of the Bigtable:

- The state of the Bigtable at some moment in time:

- How some property has changed over time:

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

### 22. Chasing metrics, not tasks: Why outcome-obsessed PMs win

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. One of my focus areas was improving our customer acquisition funnel.


**Key Points:**

- Misaligned incentives:Measuring success by task completion rather than outcome impact reinforced a culture of checking boxes rather than driving real business results.

- Letting go of sunk costs:When the data shows an initiative isn’t working, cut it – no matter how much time you’ve invested.

- Zooming out regularly:That metric you’ve been optimizing might not be the one that matters most. Don’t miss the forest for the trees.

- My metrics-focused foundation

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- The roadmap is a false comfort

- The buy-in breakthrough

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 23. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- How do you interpret the outcome of a non-inferiority test?

- How do you properly integrate non-inferiority tests into your company's A/B testing process?

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

- Example: To better understand why demonstrating “no harm” can be sufficient in certain contexts, we can once again look to an example from medicine.

- In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements.

### 24. Fail faster, learn faster: Why &#34;done&#34; beats &#34;perfect&#34; in modern product management

**Date:** 2025-05-20T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. Shipping thin slices lets you take more at-bats, improve your swing, and learn from each attempt.


**Key Points:**

- Create feedback loops to build learnings from users quickly

- Limit the potential downsides if a feature underperforms and course correct

- Build stakeholder confidence by showing visible progress

- Collect real-world feedback that no amount of planning can substitute for

- Build organizational muscle memory for rapid learning

- Create space for high-risk, high-reward ideas that might be killed in a "perfect first time" culture

- Free up resources to pursue more opportunities rather than polishing a single feature

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

### 25. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. Example: For example, let’s say you true north metric is the revenue generated in the next year. Over time, product changes can improve or degrade the quality of prediction that a particular surrogate model produces.


**Key Points:**

- Inputs should be independent of assignment. Assignment to any given experiment group should be random and not correlated to any input to the predictive model.

- Outputs should not exhibit heteroscedasticity. For each predicted value, the prediction and the expected magnitude of the error term should not be correlated.

- Best Practice for ML Engineering

- 6 Best Practices for Machine Learning

**Date:** 2025-05-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.


**Key Points:**

- Control feature releases– Seamlessly roll out features to targeted groups for testing and iteration.

- Measure impact with experimentation– Understand exactly how changes affect user behavior and business outcomes.

- Unify product data– Gain a single source of truth across users, features, and application performance.

Howie Xu, Chief AI & Innovation Officer at Gen, founder of VMware’s networking division, and AI-focused investor and lecturer at Stanford
From the slow burn of AI adoption to the messy realities of product growth, the conversation was rich with honest takes, timeless lessons, and the kind of hard-won wisdom you only get from people who’ve shipped at scale.


**Key Points:**

- Ami Vora, former CPO of Faire and VP of Product at WhatsApp and Facebook Ads

- Rajeev Rajan, CTO at Atlassian and former VP of Engineering at Facebook and Microsoft

- Howie Xu, Chief AI & Innovation Officer at Gen, founder of VMware’s networking division, and AI-focused investor and lecturer at Stanford

- Ami: At WhatsApp, the focus was on reliability and making the product feel like a utility or physical object. Fewer tests, fewer changes, and a relentless commitment to stability.

- Rajeev: Atlassian steers clear of sweeping UI overhauls in Jira. “It’s like redesigning a car dashboard—you can’t mess with muscle memory.”

- Ami: “Stay on the frontier of learning. It never feels good to be bad at something—but that’s where the learning starts.”

- Rajeev: “Forget the next title. Write the book of your life—what story do you want to tell?”

- Howie: “The new skill is TQ—token quotient. The more you engage with AI tools, the more prepared you’ll be.”

### 29. Continuous promotion for infrastructure with Statsig and Pulumi

**Date:** 2025-04-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics.


**Key Points:**

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

- Deployments that must be paused for manual sign‑off orchange‑management windows

- Initialize the Statsig server SDK at the start of your deployment.

- Get deployment decision from feature flags or dynamic configs.

- Deploy the target resources.

- Approve:Manually green‑light the next phase once metrics look good.

- Pause:Hold the rollout at the current phase to gather more data or schedule windows.

### 30. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. But when CVR improves while retention craters, the illusion breaks.


**Key Points:**

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

- Hidden cost of partial coverage:blind spots compound. Teams over‑index on the few things they do measure, and leadership starts believing an incomplete trend line.

- Integrate feature flags and experiments so every featurecanbe a testby default.

- Align engineering KPIs with metrics impact, not feature launch.

- Sunset legacy code that cannot be instrumented; it taxes every future decision.

- Why enterprises struggle:each domain team owns a slice of data; merging them requires cross‑org agreements and latency‑tolerant pipelines.

- Metrics is the language of the company. Make them clear and transparent with a centralized catalog.

- For experiments, pick a couple of primary metrics and a few guardrail metrics. Try to standardize across similar experiments.

### 31. Release pipelines: Safer, staged rollouts across your infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-04-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/release-pipelines


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we believe you can move fastwithoutbreaking things. Your 1% of users could be distributed across hundreds of clusters, and if this change causes unexpected behavior in production, it could bring down your entire infrastructure stack, as every server experiences the increased CPU and memory usage.


**Key Points:**

- Roll out changes environment by environment (dev → staging → prod)

- Target specific infrastructure segments within environments (prod-us-west → prod-us-east → prod-eu)

- Control progression between stages with time intervals or manual approvals

- Monitor each stage before proceeding to the next

- Roll back instantly if issues arise at any stage

- Catch issues early, before they affect a large portion of your infrastructure

- Prevent cascading failuresacross your entire system, ensuring higher uptime

- Validate changes in real production environmentswith minimal risk

### 33. The rise of experimentation as the industry standard

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. Example: One notable example is the16-month TV advertising experimentAmazon ran in a few markets, which showed that TV ads delivered only a modest sales bump. In the new model we grow bylearning faster—hundreds of tiny, controlled bets that compound.


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- Experimenting with the length of forms to mitigate user dropoffs

- Using 20% of an email audience to suss out the best email subject line and sending it to the remaining 80%

- Testingvirtually anythingin a focus group

- Implementing customer surveys to gauge reactions to potential upcoming initiatives

- Jeff Bezos on the importance of experimentation

- A booming market for experimentation platforms like Statsig

### 34. Digital marketing attribution models: A tech survey

**Date:** 2025-04-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. Example: Early versions were still rule-based (for example, splitting credit evenly or favoring the first and last touches). MMM emerged in the 1950s (though it rose to popularity in the 1980s) as a top-down approach that uses aggregate data and statistical regression to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel to sales [1].


**Key Points:**

- Shapley Value Attribution

- Algorithmic/Statistical Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ML)

- Incrementality Testing and Lift Models

- Causal Inference-Based Multi-Channel Attribution

- Customer Journey-based Deep Learning Models

- Captures sequential nature of journeys.

- Explains results via the “If we remove channel X, how many conversions are lost?” logic, which is intuitive.

- More nuanced than any single-position rule; channels that primarily appear in converting paths get more credit.

### 36. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Example: For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:
On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of. We also have tools likeCUPEDthat will control for values that we can see before the experiment, avoiding the worst of the bias and making your experiments run faster.


**Key Points:**

- You have to choose experiments that can be applied across pages, and that you'd expect to have a similar impact on each of the pages you'd apply it to.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

- Image optimizations,such as enabling lazy loading across all pages.

- Multimedia enhancements,like adding audio versions of blog posts to see if this boosts engagement or traffic.

- Challenges of SEO A/B testing

- Designing your experiment

### 37. How to accurately test statistical significance

**Date:** 2025-04-12T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/steps-to-accurately-test-statistical-significance


**Summary:**  
This is where the concept of statistical significance comes into play, helping you make confident choices based on solid data. Example: For example, when testing if a new feature increases user engagement, the null hypothesis would be that engagement remains unchanged. For example, when testing if a new feature increases user engagement, the null hypothesis would be that engagement remains unchanged.


**Key Points:**

- Avoid making decisions based on false positives or random noise

- Identify genuine patterns and relationships that can inform strategic choices

- Allocate resources and investments towards initiatives with proven impact

- Minimize the risk of costly mistakes or missed opportunities

- Clearly define your null and alternative hypotheses based on the question you're investigating

- Select an α that balances the risks ofType I and Type II errorsfor your specific context

- Ensure your sample size is adequate to detect meaningful differences at your chosen α

- A p-value does not indicate the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false. It only measures the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis were true.

### 38. Why A/B testing is ultimately qualitative

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-ab-testing-is-ultimately-qualitative


**Summary:**  
People with diverse perspectives have to debate options in a room, weighing pros and cons between multiple (sometimes conflicting) objectives, many of which can't be captured in a single metric.


**Key Points:**

- Start with a purpose: Don’t run experiments without a well-considered hypothesis. Don't just think aboutwhatmetrics will move, think aboutwhythey might move.

- Invite broader feedback: Listen to stakeholders who might have non-quantitative insights. They may spot factors that algorithms or dashboards might miss.

- Frame decisions as trade-offs: A/B tests often reveal gains in one metric at the expense of another. Bring in qualitative judgments about which trade-offs matter most.

- Understanding the bigger picture

- The limitations of data and the role of expert judgment

- A balanced approach: Numbers and narrative

- Talk to the pros, become a pro

### 39. Introducing CURE: Smarter regression, faster experiments

**Date:** 2025-04-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/announcing-cure


**Summary:**  
Statsig is excited to announce that we’re moving out of beta testing and into full production launch for CURE - an extension of CUPED - which allows users to add arbitrary covariate data to regression adjustment in their experiments, reducing variance even further than existing CUPED implementations. Example: For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results. For example, if users from the US tend to have a higher signup rate, including “Country” as a covariate should reduce your variance when measuring signups in an experiment—meaning you need fewer users to get meaningful results.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED: Controlled [Experiment] Using Pre-Experiment Data

- CURE: [Variance] Control Using Regression Estimates

- If you have a predictive model of future behaviors, you can easilyuse that as a covariate in CURE(like Doordash’s CUPAC)

- If you want to provide additional signal to the standard CUPAC approach, you canpick and choose different user attributes or behaviorsto add to the regression

- CURE brings powerful, flexible regression adjustment to every Statsig experiment.

### 44. Designing controlled experiments to test correlated metrics

**Date:** 2025-03-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/designing-controlled-experiments-correlated-metrics


**Summary:**  
Correlationoccurs when there is a relationship between the values of some variable with the values of some other bariable. total spend in the first 7 days a user is active may be predictive of total spend in the following 6 months
Surrogate metrics, metrics that are a leading indicator or another metric - e.g.


**Key Points:**

- Metric families, metrics that measure the same/similar phenomena - e.g. a total spend per user, total revenue per buyer, and a 0/1 indicator for purchasing

- What are correlated metrics?

- Correlated metrics in an experiment

- Metric families

- Surrogate metrics

- Intrinsic metrics

- Independence assumptions in multiple comparison corrections

### 45. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Example: For example, if you’re trying out a new shipping policy, you can apply it in one state while leaving a similar region as control. ### 3.Phased Rollouts
A phased rollout gradually increases the share of users or clusters that see a new feature (e.g., 1% to 10% to 50%), always using random assignment at each step.


**Key Points:**

- Ensure consistent assignment: If you want a single user to see the same variant as both a buyer and a seller, factor that into your randomization logic.

### 46. What no one tells you about feature flags and messy code

**Date:** 2025-03-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others. Example: Let's walk through an example. For example, if the flag is being used to slowly roll out a new checkout experience, and you're aiming for 100% rollout by the end of the month, create a “Removeff_new_checkout” ticket with a due date 30–45 days after full rollout.


**Key Points:**

- [ ] Remove all `if/else` conditions using `ff_new_checkout`

- [ ] Delete the flag from Statsig’s dashboard (mark as deprecated first)

- [ ] Remove related experiment code or tracking if applicable

- [ ] Update documentation or `FLAGS.md` if needed

- [ ] Confirmation that no users are on the legacy flow

- [ ] No recent rollbacks in the past 14 days

- When should this flag be removed?

- Who’s responsible for removing it?

### 47. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. - Tightening the Confidence (Credible) Interval:Alternatively, one can choose a narrower prior that reduces uncertainty in the posterior distribution.


**Key Points:**

- The choice of priors can strongly influence the resulting posterior estimates, requiring careful calibration to avoid unintentionally skewing the analysis.

- Neither type of informed Bayesian approach is “wrong” in principle, but the first introduces a greater risk of data manipulation, while the second can slow down decision-making.

- In many cases, the second approach is effectively equivalent to applying FDR-type frequentist adjustments and often yields the same outcomes, just framed in Bayesian terms.

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

- 1. Introduction

- 2. Literature review

- 2.1 Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches in A/B tests

**Author:** Matt Garnes  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experiment-quality-score


**Summary:**  
They have their own platform for evaluating which experiments adhere to best practices, but the biggest challenge was getting each team to look in two places for information about how they were doing. Measuringexperiment quality over timealso helps teamstrack improvements in their experimentation processand level up their decision-making confidence.


**Key Points:**

- Building is better with friends

- What is the experiment quality score?

- How to enable and configure experiment quality score

- Where to view the experiment quality score

- Measuringexperiment quality over timealso helps teamstrack improvements in their experimentation processand level up their decision-making confidence.

### 49. Why buying an experimentation platform makes more sense than building one

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/buying-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
“Building your own experimentation platform made a lot of sense… five years ago,” says our customer Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager - Core ML at Whatnot, who previously worked on DoorDash’s in-house platform. Example: For example, over the past year we’ve shipped several advanced capabilities that you won’t find in a typical experimentation platform:
- Stats methodologies such as stratified sampling, differential impact detection, interaction detection, Benjamini Hochberg procedure etc. Over the past few years, several companies have moved away from in-house experimentation tooling and turned to Statsig to scale their experimentation cultures.Notionincreased their experimentation velocity by 30x within a year.Limewent from limited testing to experimenting on every change before rolling it out.


**Key Points:**

- Server & client-side SDKsfor seamless experimentation across all surfaces without impacting performance

- Data logging, ingestion and processing servicesand/or integration with your data warehouse

- Randomization functionsfor accurate user allocations in different scenarios

- Experiment result computationsincluding metric lifts, p-values, confidence intervals, and other statistical calculations

- Automated checks(like power analysis, balanced exposures) to ensure experiments are properly set up and issues are identified proactively

- Statistical correctionsto account for outliers, pre-experimental bias, and differential impact, etc. to provide trustworthy results

- Variance reduction(CUPED, winsorization)

- Experimentation techniqueslike sequential testing, switchback testing, geo-based tests etc.

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/data-driven-marketing-attribution-shortcomings


**Summary:**  
Ideally, you’d like a tidy calculation that says, “Channel A accounts for 25% of conversions, Channel B for 40%, Channel C for 10%,” and so on.


**Key Points:**

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

- The problem: Evaluating marketing spend in a complex landscape

- What data-driven models promise

- Where they fall short in reality

### 52. KPI traps: How &#34;successful&#34; experiments can still be failures

**Date:** 2025-03-05T00:02-08:00  
**Author:** Lin Jia  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kpi-traps-successful-experiments-can-fail


**Summary:**  
You set up the experiment cautiously, collected data diligently, and celebrated when it achieved statistical significance for your KPI. Example: For example, a company notices that customer service calls are taking too long. When they run a two-week experiment to measure the impact, they find that DAU increases as more users return to the app.


**Key Points:**

- Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever.

- Success on paper, but failure in practice

- False positive risk

- False positive risk given the success rate, p-value threshold of 0.025 (successes only), and 80% power

### 56. Beyond prompts: A data-driven approach to LLM optimization

**Date:** 2025-03-04T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Anna Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/llm-optimization-online-experimentation


**Summary:**  
This article presents a systematic framework for online A/B testing of LLM applications, focusing onprompt engineering, model selection, and temperature tuning. Example: ## Experiment design and statistical rigor
### Hypothesis and goal
Define a measurable hypothesis: e.g., “Adding an example to the prompt will increase correct answer rates by 5%.” This clarity guides your metrics and success criteria. By isolating and experimenting with specific factors, teams can generate tangible improvements in performance, user engagement, and cost-efficiency.


**Key Points:**

- Improve performance: Validate hypothesis-driven changes (like new prompts) directly with real users.

- Reduce costs: Pinpoint “good enough” model variants or narrower context windows that maintain quality while lowering expenses.

- Boost engagement: Track user behaviors such as conversation length, retention, or click-through rates to ensure AI experiences resonate with users.

- Randomized user allocation: Users are split—often 50/50—so each group experiences only one variant. Randomization ensures a fair comparison.

- Single variable isolation: If testing a new prompt, keep the model and temperature consistent across both variants to attribute outcome differences to prompt changes.

- A different base model (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5).

- A refined prompt with new instructions or examples.

- Altered parameters (e.g., temperature, top-p).

### 57. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Vercel Native Integration

**Date:** 2025-02-27T07:00-12:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-vercel-native-integration


**Summary:**  
Modern web development depends on a seamless experience for users and developers. Performant, fast, and reliable websites are table stakes for users in 2025.At the same time, websites and applications are becoming increasingly complex, with more features, integrations, and components contributing to the user experience. Example: For example, if you're introducing a new navigation layout, you can first enable the flag for internal users, gather feedback, and then gradually roll it out to production—all without pushing a new deployment. No developer wants to manage extra configurations, third-party dashboards, or custom integrations, and no user wants to see a page flicker on load, or experience another 100ms wait until the page renders.


**Key Points:**

- Create and manage feature flagsto control your releases

- Run experimentsto test changes and measure impact

- Gain access to Analytics, Session Replay, and other Statsig product toolsthat don’t exist natively in your Vercel dashboard

- Use Statsig’s SDKs and Edge Config syncingfor low-latency performance without additional setup

- Install the integration:Find Statsig in the Vercel Marketplace and complete the quick setup flow

- Choose a billing plan:Both plans offer generous limits: theFree tierincludes 2M events/month, while thePro tierprovides 5M events/month for just $150

- Install Statsig and connect your Statsig project: Link your Statsig project to Vercel to sync feature flags, experiments, settings, permissions, etc.

- Initialize with Vercel’s Flags SDK or Statsig's SDK:We recommend using Vercel's Flags SDK for Next.js and SvelteKit projects; use Statsig’s SDK for all other projects

### 58. How to think about the relationship between correlation and causation

**Date:** 2025-02-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/correlation-vs-causation-guide


**Summary:**  
Yet, people still confuse correlation with causation all the time. Example: For example, this upsell that claims “4x” profile views as promised by LinkedIn Premium is definitely more correlation than causation. The trouble starts when people try to lock down a specific metric or target, like the famous claim thatadding more than 10 friends in 7 days is the key to Facebook’s engagement.


**Key Points:**

- Spot most cases of confusionbetween correlation and causation and form a clear idea of where the errors might come from.

- Grasp the essence of causal inference modelsbased on observed data. You’ll see exactly when their assumptions hold and when they don’t.

- Fifteen-year-old children who took the pill grew an average of 3 inches in one year.

- In the same schools, fifteen-year-old children who didnottake the pill grew an average of 2 inches in one year.

- Families with more money can afford the pill and give their kids better nutrition.

- Families who choose the pill care more about healthy growth and use other measures.

- Families who opt for the pill have shorter kids to begin with, so they show more “catch-up” growth.

- Most of us have heard the phrase “correlation isn’t causation.”

**Author:** Michael Makris  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-are-guardrail-metrics-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Your team designed the feature well, you set ambitious business targets, you built the feature well, and designed a solid A/B test to measure the results. Example: For example, if you're testing a new user interface, your primary metric might be the click-through rate on a feature button. While you aim to improve specific aspects of your product through A/B testing, you shouldn’t compromise on the overall system and business health.


**Key Points:**

- Ensuring that gains in one area do not cause losses in another

- Providing a holistic view of the impact of your tests

### 61. How Statsig uses query-level experiments to speed up Metrics Explorer

**Date:** 2025-02-20T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Nicole Smith  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/query-level-experiments-metrics-explorer


**Summary:**  
Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. However, when we’re making performance improvements to Metrics Explorer queries, we’re less concerned with a stable user experience for experimentation purposes, and more concerned with making them faster in every scenario.


**Key Points:**

- More funnel steps: When there are more funnel steps, the size of the temp table or CTE in question is more likely to be larger.

- Grouping by a field: This tends to make subsequent steps in the query more expensive, so having using a temp table may be more efficient when a group by is in place.

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

- The implementation

- Handling assignment

- Query event telemetry

### 71. Settings 2.0: Keeping up with a scaling product

**Date:** 2025-01-29T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Cynthia Xin  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/settings-page-design-2025


**Summary:**  
Over the past few years, Statsig has scaled significantly, adding multiple products and features to our platform. Example: In Settings 1.0, the left-side navigation menu was essentially broken down into "project" and "organization."
If users wanted to edit settings for a feature gate, for example, they needed to remember which settings were considered project settings versus organization settings, often resulting in users having to navigate different tabs just to track down one toggle. ### UI simplification
We updated the UI in Settings 2.0 to improve usability while adhering toour latest design system, Pluto.


**Key Points:**

- Members > Select a Team > Edit Team Settings

- Organization Info > Gate Settings

- Settings 2.0 introduces a main navigation and a sub-navigation

- Users can easily switch between Team, Project, and Organization settings for product features by using the sub-navigation

- We recently embarked on a journey to make our Settings page even better.

- Intuitive navigation (Product first, permission level second)

- Consolidating members, teams, and roles

- UI simplification

### 72. Stratified sampling in A/B Tests

**Date:** 2025-01-28T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/stratified-sampling-in-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Stratified sampling might just be the tool you need to bring clarity and precision to yourA/B testing efforts. Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison. This approach not only improves the quality of your data but also deepens your understanding of how different segments interact with your product.


**Key Points:**

- Identify key covariates: Look at past data to see which demographics or behaviors link closely with the changes you’re testing.

- Categorize your users: Group them by these identified covariates. This ensures each category is tested.

- Imagine you're running experiments to fine-tune your product, but your results swing wildly in every experiment you run.

- Introduction to stratified sampling in A/B testing

- Designing stratified samples for A/B tests

- Implementing stratified sampling in A/B tests

- Example: 2.) Post-hoc sampling ortools like CUPED.It's possible to filter out "extra users" in one segment post-hoc; in the example above, we could randomly filter out 6 head users from the analysis to balance a 2-2 comparison.

### 73. The ultimate guide to building an internal feature flagging system

**Date:** 2025-01-27T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
“Why do people pay for this?”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions. Example: You’re also likely to find some synergies in the code you write across these two services - for example, the service that provides evaluated flag values to clients can borrow logic from the code that evaluates rulesets on your servers, provided they’re written in the same language. - Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?


**Key Points:**

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

- Handle targeting on any user trait, like app version, country, IP address, etc.?

- Have extremely high uptime?

- test a feature in production (by “gating” it to only employees/ beta testers)

- rollout a feature to only certain geographies (by “gating” on user countries)

- run an A/B test (by gating a feature to a random 50% of userIDs)

- Or Run acanary release(release a feature to a random 10% of userIDs, to check that it doesn’t break anything)

### 74. Detecting interaction effects of concurrent experiments

**Date:** 2025-01-13T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Kane Luo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/interaction-effect-detection


**Summary:**  
To accelerate experimentation, medium to large companies run hundreds of A/B tests simultaneously, aiming to isolate and measure the impact of each change, also known as the "main effect."
However, when multiple tests target the same area of your product, they can influence one another, resulting in either overestimation or underestimation of metric changes. Example: For example, to understand the effect of dark mode without the transition animation, you would compare group C to group A using a standard two-sample t-test. This expands the UI compatibility and aims to improve retention.


**Key Points:**

- Relaunch the same experimentsto a mutually exclusive audience. This is especially useful if you need more statistical power particularly on secondary metrics.

- Conduct manual statistical testsand determine which one of the two features to ship.

- If the interaction is synergistic, you candouble down on the combined experience, by either launching a new test or analyzing group A and D.

- Rework the experienceto make the feature compatible.

- Statsig now offersinteraction effect detectionto uncover the hidden effects of experiments on each other.

- Scenario: Dark mode gone wrong

- How do we diagnose it?

- My experiments are interacting—now what?

### 76. How to report test results

**Date:** 2025-01-02T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-report-test-results


**Summary:**  
Now comes the critical moment—communicating your insights to your company’s stakeholders. Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups. Analysts may prematurely generalize sample results to the population, leading to overly definitive claims such as, “This feature will increase revenue by 10%” or “The conversion rate in the new version improved by 5%.”
How to get it right: When communicating test results, it’s crucial to remember that your data reflects what happens in your sample and may not precisely represent the population.


**Key Points:**

- Secondary KPIs: For secondary KPIs, summarize the results visually or in a table that includes the uplift, the boundaries of the confidence interval, and the p-value.

- 1. Overstating certainty

- 2. Confusing Test Settings with Test Results

- 3. Misinterpreting p-values

- 4. Misinterpreting confidence interval

- 5. Ignoring external validity

- An example: Report of test’s results

- Example: For example, an analyst may want to determine whether a new version of an app attracts more sign-ups.

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/key-problems-in-d2c-that-experimentation-solves


**Summary:**  
“Half your ideas will fail… you need to verify and tweak your ideas until they actually deliver value for the customer.”
– Wyatt Thompson, Dollar Shave Club
## Why D2C brands face unique challenges
Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands thrive by forging direct relationships with customers—yet this also makes them vulnerable to every friction point along the user journey. Example: For example, small tweaks to the timing or format of promotional emails can reduce churn and encourage repeat purchases within 28 days. keyword-based) or surface trending bundles (“Complete the look”) to see which approach not only increases product visibility but also boosts average order value.


**Key Points:**

- For direct-to-consumer brands, data-driven testing is the real game-changer.

- Why D2C brands face unique challenges

- Friction during first-time conversions

- Overlooked opportunities in product discovery

### 80. One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/one-tailed-vs-two-tailed-tests


**Summary:**  
If your answer is no—or if you’re not even sure what this means—then this blog is for you! Example: Reviewing the previous graph can help illustrate this: for example, a result in the left tail might be significant under a two-tailed hypothesis but not under a right one-tailed hypothesis. Note that the purple area is larger for the one-tailed hypothesis, compared to the two-tailed hypothesis:
In practice, to maintain the desired power level, we compensate for the reduced power of a two-tailed hypothesis by increasing the sample size (Increasing sample size raises power, though the mechanics of this can be a topic for a separate article).


**Key Points:**

- One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Hypothesis Testing: Understanding the Difference

- Why does it make a difference?

- How to decide between one-tailed and two-tailed hypothesis?

- Get started now!

### 81. When allocation point and exposure point differ

**Date:** 2024-12-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/when-allocation-point-and-exposure-point-differ


**Summary:**  
Since this feature isn’t visible when the page loads, users in the test group might leave before scrolling down to see it. Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not. If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.


**Key Points:**

- Why does it happen?

- Why does it matter?

- What should you do?

- Talk A/B testing with the pros

- Example: For example, in email campaigns where we A/B test content, we often lack visibility on who opened the email and who did not.

- If you’re aiming to identify the true impact of your new version—especially when a real effect exists—this discrepancy is crucial: misalignment between allocation and exposure points can reduce your ability to detect the effect of the new version, potentially obscuring valuable improvements to your product.

### 83. You don&#39;t need large sample sizes to run A/B tests

**Date:** 2024-12-12T03:15+00:00  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/you-dont-need-large-sample-sizes-ab-tests


**Summary:**  
Yet many small and medium-sized companies aren’t running A/B Tests. Example: Google routinely runs large search tests on a massive scale, for example 100,000,000 users where a+0.1% effect on topline metrics is a big win. A/B testing is a pillar of data-driven product development irrespective of the product’s size
### Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing
Startup companies have a major advantage in experimentation:huge potential and upside.Startups don’t play the micro-optimization game; they don’t care about a +0.2% increase in click-through rates.


**Key Points:**

- CUPED(Controlled Experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) leverages historical metrics to reduce noise and refine your estimates.

- Stratified Samplingensures balanced and reliable comparisons across small, skewed user segments.

- Differential Impactcan reveal directional and qualitative findings, providing a little more color to the results of your experiment.

- Small companies’ secret advantage in experimentation

- Startups’ secret weapon in A/B testing

### 85. Announcing the Statsig &lt;&gt; Azure AI Integration

**Date:** 2024-11-19T05:30-08:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/azure-ai-annoucement


**Summary:**  
In the past year, AI has gone from interesting to impactful. While people had built AI applications prior to 2024, there were few that had achieved massive scale. Example: Here’s an example of a dynamic config:
Once you’ve created this client, calling a model in code is easy. Once this is implemented, all you need to do to adjust the configuration of your model is to change the value of your dynamic config in Statsig.Once the change to the config is made, it will be live in any target applications in ~10 seconds!


**Key Points:**

- Configure your Azure AI modelsfrom a single pane of glass

- Implement Azure AI models in codeusing a simple, lightweight framework

- Automatically collect a variety of metricson model & application performance

- Run powerful A/B tests and experimentsto optimize your AI application

- Compute the results of all tests automatically- with no additional work required

- They provide a layer of abstraction from direct Azure AI API calls, letting you store API parameters in a config and change them dynamically (rather than making code changes)

- They give you a simplified framework for implementing Azure AI models in code

- Targeting releases to internal users to test changes in your production environment

### 87. It’s normal not to be normal(ly distributed): what to do when data is not normally distributed

**Date:** 2024-10-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-to-do-when-data-is-not-normally-distributed


**Summary:**  
Gosset wanted to estimate the quality of the company’s beer, but was concerned that existing statistical methods would be unreliable due to a small sample size. Example: A familiar example is election polling: statisticians want to predict the outcome for all voters but must rely on a sample of survey responses. Key statistical principles, such as the Central Limit Theorem and Slutsky’s Theorem, show that as the sample size increases, the t statistic converges toward a normal distribution.


**Key Points:**

- Normal distribution: the KPI follows a normal distribution.

- Non-normal distribution: the KPI has a non-normal distribution.

- William Sealy Gosset, a former Head Brewer at Guinness Brewery, had a problem.

- Why do we need the normality assumption?

- The normality assumption with large sample sizes

- So, t-test it is?

- Example: A familiar example is election polling: statisticians want to predict the outcome for all voters but must rely on a sample of survey responses.

- Key statistical principles, such as the Central Limit Theorem and Slutsky’s Theorem, show that as the sample size increases, the t statistic converges toward a normal distribution.

**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-rollouts-examples


**Summary:**  
Instagram was becoming the primary medium for keeping tabs on friends and influencers alike—perceiving the world through their iPhone lenses, in a way. Example: Take Spotify Wrapped, for example.

### 91. How A/B testing platforms make data science more interesting

**Date:** 2024-10-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-ab-testing-platforms-make-data-science-more-interesting


**Summary:**  
A/B testing platforms have become highly efficient, automating much of the mundane work involved in setting up, calculating, and reporting on experiments. Example: "An engineer that improves server performance by ten milliseconds more than pays for his or her fully loaded annual costs."
Illustrating the tangible impact of small improvements, Kohavi shared this powerful example. ## Excerpts
"Most experiments fail to improve the metrics they were designed to improve."
Kohavi highlighted a counterintuitive reality: the majority of experiments don't yield the expected positive results.


**Key Points:**

- What’s the current state of experimentation automation since the release of the Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (the "Hippo" book)?

- How does this automation impact the role of data scientists?

- What should data scientists focus on moving forward?

- How can we secure leadership buy-in for experimentation efforts?

- Over the past few years, the data science landscape has fundamentally changed.

- My questions to Ronny:

- Three takeaways

- Experimentation automation benefits data scientists both directly and indirectly

**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimental-meta-analysis-and-knowledge-base


**Summary:**  
Over the past three years, we’ve seen several companies significantly scale their experimentation culture, often increasing their experimentation velocity by 10-30x within a year. Example: For example, if you’ve spent a quarter testing ways to optimize product recommendations in your e-commerce app, an individual experiment might guide a ship decision. Whatnot hit a run rate of 400 experiments last year,Notion scaled from single-digit to hundreds per quarter,Rec Room went from nearly zero to 150 experimentsin their first year with Statsig, andLime started testing every change they roll out.


**Key Points:**

- What experiments are running now?

- When are they expected to end?

- What % of experiments ship Control vs Test?

- What is the typical duration?

- Do experiments run for their planned duration or much longer or shorter?

- Do experiments impact key business metrics or only shallow or team-level metrics?

- How much do they impact key business metrics?

- The value of experimentation compounds as you run more experiments.

### 99. Why you should &#34;accept&#34; the null hypothesis when hypothesis testing

**Date:** 2024-09-25T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/hypothesis-testing-accept-null


**Summary:**  
You can only fail to reject it!” is widely circulated but fundamentally flawed.


**Key Points:**

- Many people mistakenly interpret "accepting" the null as "proving" it, which is incorrect.

- Null and alternative hypotheses treated symmetrically:Both (H_0) and (H_1) are explicitly defined, and tests are designed to decide between them based on the data.

- Fisher:The alternative hypothesis is often implicit or not formally specified. The focus is on assessing evidence against (H_0).

- Neyman-Pearson:The alternative hypothesis ((H_1)) is explicitly defined, and tests are constructed to distinguish between (H_0) and (H_1).

- Fisher:Emphasizes measuring evidence against (H_0) without necessarily making a final decision.

- Neyman-Pearson:Emphasizes making a decision between (H_0) and (H_1), incorporating the long-run frequencies of errors.

- Fisher's Null Hypothesis:A unique, specific hypothesis tested to see if there is significant evidence against it, using p-values as a measure of evidence.

**Date:** 2024-09-23T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Katie Braden  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/comparing-feature-flag-platform-costs


**Summary:**  
To simplify the process, we’ve put togethera spreadsheet comparing pricing, complete with all the formulas we used and any assumptions we made.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig offers the lowest pricing across all usage levels, with free gates for non-analytics use cases (i.e., if a gate is used for an A/B test).

- Launch Darkly’s cost for client-side SDKs reachesthe highest levels across all platformsafter ~100k MAU.

- PostHog client-side SDK costs stand as the second cheapestacross feature flag platforms while still racking uphundreds of dollars for usage over 1M requests.

- The assumption of 20 sessions per MAU is made on the basis that each active user is assumed to have 20 unique sessions each month.

- One request per session is used, given a standard 1:1 ratio for requests and sessions.

- 20 gates instrumented per MAU made on the assumption of using 20 gates in a given product.

- 50% of gates checked each session is used as a benchmark on the basis of users only triggering half of the gates in a given session.

- One context (client-side users, devices, or organizations that encounter feature flags in a product within a month) per MAU given the close definition of the two.

### 102. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Example: Funnels allow you to measure complex relationships with a higher degree of clarity.For example, you see revenue flatten, but product page views are going up. If you care about improving your checkout flow for products, tracking this data at a session level is more powerful, measuring (successes / tries) instead of (successful users / users who tried)
Consider when a user vs.


**Key Points:**

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- Statistical rigor:Make sure funnel conversions have the delta method applied and have sound practices for ordinal logic.

- Ordered events:For funnels to be really useful, you should be able to specify that users do events in a specific sequence over time.

- Multiple-step funnels:Two-step funnels can be useful, but the ability to add intermediate steps as needed for richer understanding is critical.

- Step-level and overall conversion changes:This is how you can identifywheredrop-offs happen.

- Calculation windows:Being able to specify the maximum duration a user has to finish a funnel is critical to running longer experiments.

### 103. I want it that way: Building experimentation infrastructure and culture with Ronny Kohavi 

**Date:** 2024-09-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Morgan Scalzo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-experimentation-infrastructure-and-culture-ronny-kohavi


**Summary:**  
We recently hosted a virtual meetup featuring Allon Korem, CEO ofBell, and Ronny Kohavi, awidely respected thought leaderand expert in experimentation. Example: For example, a p-value of 0.01 does not mean there is a 99% chance of success. - Experimentation culture: Establishing an organizational culture that embraces experimentation is vital for continuous growth and improvement.


**Key Points:**

- Case study: Only 12% of 1,000 experiments succeeded, illustrating the harsh reality that many organizations must accept—a high failure rate is normal.

- Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches: They covered the differences between these two statistical approaches and their applications in experimentation.

- A/A tests as best practice: RunningA/A testsis strongly recommended to validate experimentation setups and ensure the reliability of testing infrastructure.

- Asymmetric allocation: This approach can provide advantages to the larger group in an experiment, optimizing for specific outcomes.

- You can always learn something from people with lots of experience.

- Key insights from Ronny Kohavi

- Should every organization aim for "fly" in every category?

- Discussion on failures

### 105. How Meta made me a big-time A/B testing advocate

**Date:** 2024-09-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/meta-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
I wanted to show my data scientist audience how powerful Deltoid is, yet was prohibited from doing so as it’s an internal tool. Example: For example, inan earlier video, I discussed how AB testing shapes the meritocracy and competitive culture at Facebook. We found thatthe white background caused a decrease in click-through rate and conversion rate:It made users feel like they were in a traditional e-commerce experience, rather than browsing for deals.


**Key Points:**

- I recordedStatsig’s first public demoover three years ago.

- Measuring our failure

- Understanding our failure

- The difference a white background can make

- The counterfactual of no A/B testing

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, inan earlier video, I discussed how AB testing shapes the meritocracy and competitive culture at Facebook.

### 107. Why Kayak lets you pick your plane

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kayak-aircraft-filter-feature


**Summary:**  
And neither were the passengers of Alaska Airlines flight 1282, whose emergency exit door fell out in January, forcing the pilot of the Boeing 737 Max to conduct an emergency landing. Example: Steve Hafner, the CEO of Kayak, goes on to say, “While the overall fraction of users filtering the 737 remains small, usage increased following the Alaska Airlines incident in January(15x compared to month prior from a low baseline), and it has since decreased until this past week (to 10x compared to Dec 2023).”
## What Kayak did right
This is a great example of companies reacting to user sentiment.

### 108. What is A/B testing and why is it important?

**Date:** 2024-09-05T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/what-is-a-b-testing-and-why-is-it-important


**Summary:**  
Underlying AB testing is the concept of “randomized controlled trials (RCTs).” It is the gold standard in finding causality. Example: Let’s use one quick example, which also illustrates what “random assignment” is and its importance. ## Understanding treatment effect with an example
Suppose I claim that I have a magic pill that costs $100 and can increase the height of high school students by 1 inch over a year.


**Key Points:**

- With randomized assignments, the difference between the treatment group and the control group iscaused by the treatment.

- Test group:1000 students who voluntarily took the pill a year ago. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 62 inches this year.

- Control group:1000 students from the same schools with the same age. Their average height was 60 inches a year ago and 61 inches this year.

- Claim:We shipped a feature and metrics increased 10%

- Reality:The metrics will increase 10% without the feature, such as shipping a Black Friday banner before Black Friday.

- Claim:We shipped a feature, and users who use the feature saw 10% increase in their metrics

- Reality:The users who self-select into using the feature would see a 10% increase without the feature, such as giving a button to power users(ref: why most aha moments are wrong?)

- Humans are bad at attributions and are subject to lots of biases

Example: For example, a differential baseline between groups prior to a treatment is not statistically biased, but it is undesirable for making business decisions and usually requires resetting the test. In such cases, the cost of maintaining more experiments increases super-linearly, while the benefits increase sub-linearly.


**Key Points:**

- Historical Relevance:Experiments serve both decision-making and learning purposes, requiring a comprehensive understanding of both current and past experiments.

- Managerial incentives often encourage detrimental behaviors, such as p-hacking.

- Experiments may result in technical debt by leaving configurations within the codebase.

- The marginal return of experiments increases linearly or sub-linearly with scale, as less effort is available to turn information into impact.

- The marginal cost of experiments increases super-linearly with scale due to information and managerial overhead.

- Default-on experiments on all new features.

- Define metrics once, use everywhere.

- Reliable, traceable, and transparent data.

### 113. Why the uplift in A/B tests often differs from real-world results

**Date:** 2024-08-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-the-uplift-in-a-b-tests-often-differs-from-real-world


**Summary:**  
This disconnect can be puzzling and disappointing, especially when decisions and expectations are built around these tests. Example: A common example I’ve encountered with clients involves tests that yield inconclusive (non-significant) results. While reducing the significance level can decrease the number of false positives, it would also require longer test durations, which may not always be feasible.


**Key Points:**

- Human bias in analysis and interpretation

- False positives

- Sequential testing and overstated effect sizes

- Novelty effect and user behavior

- External validity and real-world factors

- Limited exposure in testing

- Strategies for mitigating discrepancies

### 115. How to pick metrics that make or break your experiments (including do&#39;s and don&#39;ts)

**Date:** 2024-08-14T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Elizabeth George  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-metrics-that-make-or-break-your-experiments


**Summary:**  
In fact, the wrong metrics can not only mislead your results but can also derail your entire strategy.


**Key Points:**

- Have a razor-sharp focus on one primary behavioral metric and a clearly aligned business metric.

- Anticipate and measure the negative consequences of your changes—because they’re inevitable.

- Use secondary metrics to fill in the gaps in your understanding. Without them, you’re operating in the dark.

- Ensure your experiment has enough power to provide conclusive, reliable results. Anything less is a waste of time.

- Stick with the same business metric for every experiment. If it doesn’t align with your specific goals, it’s irrelevant.

- Overcomplicate your analysis with a laundry list of metrics. Clarity and focus are your allies; distraction is your enemy.

- Over-interpret secondary data. If it’s not part of your primary hypothesis, it’s noise—don’t let it lead you astray.

- Your experiments are only as good as the metrics you choose.

### 116. How to plan test duration when using CUPED

**Date:** 2024-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-plan-test-duration-cuped


**Summary:**  
You understand that failing to plan the test duration can lead to underpowered tests and inflated false positive rates due to peeking. Example: Example:
In reality, we don't know the true values of the variables, so we must estimate them. Recently, you've been introduced toCUPED, an advanced statistical method that reduces KPI variance, resulting in more sensitive tests (lower MDE) or shorter test durations (lower sample size).


**Key Points:**

- Calculate the Non-CUPED Sample Size: Use the regular t-test sample size formula.

- Adjust Sample Size: Reduce the calculated sample size by the factor of \(\rho^2\).

- Suppose the non-CUPED sample size is 1000.

- Historical sampled data shows an estimated Pearson correlation of 0.9 between \(X\) and \(Y\).

- Calculate the variance reduction factor: \(0.9^2 = 0.81\).

- Adjust the sample size: \(1000 \times (1 - 0.81) = 190\).

**Date:** 2024-07-31T10:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/controlling-type-i-errors-bonferroni-benjamini-hochberg


**Summary:**  
TheBenjamini-Hochberg Procedureis now available on Statsig as a way to reduce your false positives. Example: - FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons
FWER = the probability of making any Type I errors in any of the comparisons
- FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it
FDR = the probability of a null hypothesis being true when you’ve rejected it
For each metric evaluation of one variant vs the control, we have:
In any online experiment, we’re likely to have more than just 1 metric and one variant in a given experiment, for example:
We generally recommend the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure as a less severe measure than the Bonferroni Correction, but which still protects you from some amount Type I errors.


**Key Points:**

- (Type I Error) I’m making unnecessary changes that don’t actually improve our product.

- (Type II Error) I missed an opportunity to make our product better because I didn’t detect a difference in my experiment.

### 126. Top 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them

**Date:** 2024-07-18T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/top-8-common-experimentation-mistakes-how-to-fix


**Summary:**  
I recently down with Allon Korem, CEO ofBell Statistics, and Tyler VanHaren, Software Engineer at Statsig, to discuss some of the most frequent mistakes companies can make in A/B testing and experimentation! I've summarized the discussion and outlined the 8 common experimentation mistakes and how to fix them. By addressing these common testing mistakes, companies can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of their A/B tests.


**Key Points:**

- Data integrity:Ensure that your allocation point is consistent and verify your distributions using chi-squared tests to detect sample ratio mismatches.

- Skepticism and Vigilance:Regularly check data integrity over different segments and time periods to identify inconsistencies early.

- Proper Metrics:Collaborate with data science teams to ensure metrics are correctly defined and measured, focusing on meaningful business-driven KPIs.

- Statistical Methods:Use t-tests for means and z-tests for proportions in most cases. Ensure your statistical tests are relevant to your hypotheses.

- Peeking:Use sequential testing approaches to manage peeking. Tools like Statsig provide inflated confidence intervals for early data to mitigate premature conclusions.

- Underpowered Tests:Plan tests meticulously using power analysis calculators to ensure you have sufficient data to detect the expected changes.

- Handling Outliers:Use Windsorization to cap extreme values rather than removing outliers entirely, maintaining the integrity of your data.

- Cultural Challenges:Foster a culture that encourages upfront hypothesis formulation and continuous learning from experimentation.

### 127. Introducing Differential Impact Detection 

**Date:** 2024-07-17T09:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/differential-impact-detection


**Summary:**  
Statsig can now automatically surface heterogenous treatment effects across your user properties. In experimentation “one size fits all” is not always true. Example: For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users. For example, the addition of a new and improved tutorial might be very helpful for new users but have no impact for tenured users.


**Key Points:**

- Investigate the top sub-populations across each user property that you specify as a “Segment of Interest”

- For each primary metric in the experiment, determine if any sub-population has a different response to treatment

- Automatically surface a visualization of metrics sliced by user segments where one or more sub-population behaves significantly differently from the rest of the population

- Apply Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparison (check implementation details at the end)

- Concise Summarization of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Using Total Variation Regularized Regression

### 129. How to Ingest Data Into Statsig

**Date:** 2024-07-16T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Logan Bates  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-ingest-data-into-statsig


**Summary:**  
During my endeavors as a data engineer, I’d spend hours helping teams translate data models and building data pipelines between software tools so they could effectively communicate. The frustration of getting the data into tools often spoiled the intended initial experience and added complexities to a production implementation. Event filters can be utilized to reduce downstream event volume to Statsig, so only your relevant metrics are analyzed.


**Key Points:**

- Access to your data source (e.g., data warehouse, 3rd party data tool/CDP, or application code).

- Necessary permissions to read from and write to your data source. (if applicable)

- Familiarity with SQL (if you're using a data warehouse)

- Use thelogEventmethod in various languages to quickly populate Statsig with data for experimentation and analysis

- Log additional metrics alongside 3rd party or internal logging systems to enhance measurement capabilities

- Use in situations where the SDKs are not supported or preferred

- Can be used to support custom metric ingestion workflows

- Quickly populate Statsig with metric data and analyze with themetrics explorer

### 130. Product experimentation best practices

**Date:** 2024-07-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/product-experimentation-best-practices


**Summary:**  
A good design document eliminates much of the ambiguity and uncertainty often encountered in the analysis and decision-making stages. Example: For example:
- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric
- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs
### Power analysis, allocation, and duration
Allocation
This is the percentage of the user base that will be eligible for this experiment. These often include:
- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)
- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)
Se


**Key Points:**

- Top-level metrics we hope to improve with the experiment (Goal metrics)

- Other important company or org-level metrics we don’t want to regress (Guardrail metrics)

- A breakdown of different metrics that contribute to the goal metric

- Metrics that are “complementary” to the goal metric and could reveal cannibalization effects or trade-offs

- Running concurrent, mutually exclusive experiments requires allocating a fraction of the user base to each experiment.  On Statsig this is handled withLayers.

- A smaller allocation may be preferable for high-risk experiments, especially when the overall user base is large enough.

- For guardrail metrics: The MDE should be the largest regression size you’re willing to miss and ship unknowingly.

- Use power analysis to determine the duration needed to reach the MDE for each the those primary metrics. If they yield different results, pick the longest one.

### 132. An overview of making early decisions on experiments 

**Date:** 2024-07-05T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Mike London   
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/making-early-decisions-on-experiments


**Summary:**  
Online experimentation is becoming more commonplace across all types of businesses today. #### Rewards:
- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.


**Key Points:**

- Noisy data:Early data can be noisy and may not represent the true effect of the experiment, leading to incorrect conclusions (higher likelihood of false positives/false negatives).

- Early insights:Early results can provide quick feedback, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of features.

- Resource allocation:Identifying a strong positive or negative trend can help decide whether to continue investing resources in the experiment.

- Select a population: Choose the appropriate population for your experiment. This could be based on a past experiment, a qualifying event, or the entire user base.

- Choose metrics: Input the metrics you plan to use as your evaluation criteria. You can add multiple metrics to analyze sensitivity in your target population.

- Run the power analysis: Provide the above inputs to the tool. Statsig will simulate an experiment, calculating population sizes and variance based on historical behavior.

- Review the readout: Examine the week-by-week simulation results. This will show estimates of the number of users eligible for the experiment each day, derived from historical data.

- It can shrink confidence intervals and p-values, which means that statistically significant results can be achieved with a smaller sample size.

### 133. Understanding significance levels: A key to accurate data analysis

**Date:** 2024-07-03  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-significance-levels-a-key-to-accurate-data-analysis


**Summary:**  
In this post, we provide an introduction to significance levels, what they are, and why they are important for data analysis. Example: For example, let's say you're comparing two versions of a feature using an A/B test. A lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) reduces the risk offalse positivesbut increases the risk of false negatives.


**Key Points:**

- P-values don't measure the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false.

- A statistically significant result doesn't necessarily imply practical significance or importance.

- The significance level (α) is not the probability of making a Type I error (false positive).

- In fields like medicine or aviation, where false positives can have severe consequences, a lower significance level (e.g., 0.01) may be more appropriate.

- For exploratory studies or when false negatives are more problematic, a higher significance level (e.g., 0.10) might be justified.

- P-values don't provide information about themagnitude or practical importanceof an effect.

- Focusing exclusively on p-values can lead to thefile drawer problem, where non-significant results are less likely to be published, creating a biased literature.

- P-values are influenced by sample size; large samples can yield statistically significant results for small, practically unimportant effects.

### 134. Statsig&#39;s Eurotrip: A/B Talks Roadshow Highlights

**Date:** 2024-06-27T11:00-08:00  
**Author:** Morgan Scalzo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-eurotrip-a-b-talks-roadshow-highlights


**Summary:**  
Earlier this month, the Statsig team crossed the pond to host events in Berlin and London. Marcos Arribas, Statsig's Head of Engineering, led panels in each city with leaders from Monzo, HelloFresh, N26, Captify, Bell Statistics, Babbel, and more. - An experimentation mindset helps validate ideas through minimum viable experiments, enabling faster and more efficient project development.


**Key Points:**

- Establishing a data-driven culture requires more than hiring data scientists; it starts with organized data and robust engineering practices.

- Standardizing definitions and metrics ensure reliable and comparable data-driven decisions.

- Mature organizations must balance short-term gains with long-term impacts in their experiments.

- The main challenge is often knowing the right questions to ask and framing problems correctly.

- Leaders foster a data-driven culture by asking data-centric questions and rewarding data-focused behaviors.

### 137. Statsig&#39;s Autotune adds contextual bandits for personalization

**Date:** 2024-06-26T11:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-autotune-contextual-bandits-personalization


**Summary:**  
These contextual bandits are a lightweight form of reinforcement learning that gives teams an easy way to personalize user experiences. Example: For example, a contextual bandit is a great choice to personalize if a user should see “Sports”, “Science”, or “Celebrities” as their top video unit; but it won’t be a good fit for determining which video (with new candidates every day, and with potentially tens of thousands of options) to show them. Running a few tests with Autotune AI can quickly give signal on how much there is to gain from personalizing product surfaces - potentially justifying investing in a dedicated team
## Start measuring your personalization
Hundreds of customers already use Statsig to measure improvements to theirpersonalization program.


**Key Points:**

- Don’t yet have the bandwidth to solve these problems, but want a placeholder for personalization as their teams get more mission-critical parts of their product built

- We’re excited to announce that Statsig’s multi-armed bandit platform (Autotune)now includes contextual bandits.

- When to use contextual bandits

- Hit the perfect note with Autotuned experiments

- Bring your own training data

### 138. Warehouse Native Year in Review

**Date:** 2024-06-25T12:15-08:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/warehouse-native-year-in-review


**Summary:**  
Since then, Warehouse Native has grown into a core product for us; we treat it with the same priority as Statsig Cloud, and have developed the two products to share core infrastructure, methodology, and design philosophies. Example: - More tools in the warehouse; for example, we have a beta version ofMetrics Explorerfor warehouse native customers and are excited to continue developing this - sharing a metric definition language between quick metric explorations and advanced statistical calculations helps bridge the gap between exploratory work and rigorous measurement. One of the competitive advantages we think Statsig has is “clock speed” - we just build faster than other teams building the same thing.


**Key Points:**

- Willingness - and internal/external alignment - to ship things that were functional-but-ugly

- Letting the development team play to their strengths

- Treating early customers like team members

- An Engineering “Code Machine” - someone who could crank out quality code twice as fast as other engineers

- A PM “Tech Lead” - someone who leads efforts across the company

- A DS “Product Hybrid” - someone who bridges product and engineering to solve complex business problems

- A year ago, Statsig announced Warehouse Native, bringing our experimentation platform into customers’ Data Warehouses.

- Why warehouse native?

### 148. How to debug your experiments and feature rollouts

**Date:** 2024-05-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-debug-your-experiments-and-feature-rollouts


**Summary:**  
Whether you're a data scientist, a product manager, or a software engineer, you know that even the most meticulously planned test rollout can encounter unexpected hiccups. Example: Statsig also allows you to override specific users, for example, if you wanted to test your feature with employees first in production. Statsig also offersstratified sampling; When experimenting on a user base where a tail-end of power users drive a large portion of an overall metric value, stratified sampling meaningfully reduces false positive rates and makes your results more consistent and trustworthy.


**Key Points:**

- Inadequate sampling: A sample that's too small or not representative of an evenly weighted distribution can lead to inconclusive or misleading results.

- Lack of confidence in metrics: Without trustworthy success metrics, it's harder to determine how to make a decision.

- User exposure issues: If users aren't exposed to the experiment as intended, your data won't reflect their true behavior.

- Biased experiments: Running multiple experiments that affect the same variables can contaminate your results.

- Technical errors: Bugs in the code can introduce unexpected variables that impact the experiment's outcome.

- Success criteria: Before launching an experiment, it's crucial to define how you’re measuring success. Make these metrics readily available for analysis.

- Running experiments mutually exclusively: To prevent experiments from influencing each other, consider using feature flagging frameworks.

- When it comes to digital experimentation and feature rollouts, the devil is often in the details.

### 151. How to track your features&#39; retention

**Date:** 2024-05-17T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-track-your-features-retention


**Summary:**  
The most common use of retention metrics that you’re familiar with, when A and B are the same action over different time periods T0 and T1, is just a special case of this more generalized definition. Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage. For example, day-of-week seasonality can be aggregated away by setting T0 and T1 to be 7 days in duration and measuring retention on a weekly cadence.


**Key Points:**

- Choosing appropriate A, B, T0, and T1

- The specificity vs sample size trade-off (choosing A)

- When repeated feature usage is more/less meaningful (choosing B)

- Evaluating useful time ranges (choosing T0, T1, and how many retention data points to generate)

- Using Metrics Explorer on Statsig to track feature retention

- Get started now!

- Example: For example, since Statsig is a product that folks use for work, we typically see much more weekday usage than weekend usage.

**Date:** 2024-04-19T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-experiments-technical-guide


**Summary:**  
Experimentation in such environments is not just beneficial; it's essential. Example: For example, during an early proof of concept, a customer tested search functionality in their marketplace. This allows you to observe if an increase in one area is causing a decrease in another, indicating cannibalization, or if improvements in one part of the marketplace are positively affecting other areas, indicating spillover benefits.Statsig's experimentation platform allows you tochoose any unit of randomizationto analyze different user groups, pages, sessions, and other dimensions, which can help in understanding the nuanced effects of experiments across the marketplace.


**Key Points:**

- Switchback testing: Ideal for marketplaces, switchback tests help mitigate time-related biases by alternating between treatment and control at different times.

- In Statsig, you can createcustom metricsthat measure buyer side and seller side, further refining analysis.

- Statsig exposes fine grain controls allowing you to build custom inclusion/exclusion criteria.

- In analysis, Statsig allows you to facet metric analysis by user properties or event properties. You can also filter experiment results based on user groups.

- Leveragestratified samplingto ensure equal distribution within test groups.

- Statsig’s user bucketing is deterministic; this makes it consistent across sessions, devices, etc.

- Statsig can also facilitate analysis across anonymous to known user funnels.

### 166. When to use Bayesian experiments: A beginner’s guide

**Date:** 2024-04-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-experiments-beginners-guide


**Summary:**  
Traditionally, A/B testing has been dominated by Frequentist statistics, which rely on p-values and confidence intervals to make decisions. - Prior information is available: If you have reliable historical data or expert knowledge, Bayesian experiments can use that information to improve the accuracy of the results.


**Key Points:**

- Small sample sizes: When you have limited data, Bayesian methods can be more robust since they can leverage prior information to make up for the lack of data.

- Sequential analysis: Bayesian experiments are well-suited for situations where you want to look at the results continuously and potentially stop the test early.

- Complex models: If you're dealing with complex models or multiple metrics, Bayesian methods can help manage the intricacies more effectively.

- Prior information is available: If you have reliable historical data or expert knowledge, Bayesian experiments can use that information to improve the accuracy of the results.

- Flexibility: Bayesian experiments can be updated continuously as new data comes in, making them well-suited for dynamic environments where conditions change rapidly.

- Clear decision-making: With Bayesian testing, you can quantify the risk associated with a decision, such as the expected loss if a new feature underperforms.

- A Statsig account with access to the experiments feature.

- A clear hypothesis and defined metrics for your experiment.

### 178. The distinction between experiments and feature flags

**Date:** 2024-03-29T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/distinction-between-experiments-and-feature-flags


**Summary:**  
Feature flagsact as the straightforward gatekeepers of deployment, offering a choice—on or off—for introducing new features. As the quick experiment tool evolved, and its experimental rigor increased which ultimately caused us to lose our ability to create simple A/B tests like Gatekeeper originally allowed.

### 179. Novelty effects: Everything you need to know

**Date:** 2024-03-20T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/novelty-effects


**Summary:**  
Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness. Example: For example, feature level funnel, and feature level retention, can tell us whether users finished using the feature as we intended and whether they come back to the feature. Imagine this – the restaurant you pass by every day had a 100% improvement on their menu, their chef and their services.


**Key Points:**

- Novelty effects refer to the phenomenon where the response to a new feature is temporarily deviated from its inherent value due to its newness.

- Not all products have novelty effects. They exist mostly in high-frequency products.

- Ignoring the temporary nature of novelty effects may lead to incorrect product decisions, and worse, bad culture.

- The most effective way to find novelty effects and control them is to examinethe time series of treatment effects.

- The root cause solution is to use a set of metrics that correctly represent user intents.

- When understood and used correctly, novelty effects can help you.

- Novelty effects are part of the treatment effects, so there is no statistical method to detect them generically

- Novelty effects are dangerous and will spread if you don’t combat them

### 180. How to monitor the long term effects of your experiment

**Date:** 2024-03-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-monitor-the-long-term-effects-of-your-experiment


**Summary:**  
Now, imagine discovering six months later that it actually reduced long-term retention. Example: Let's get practical with an example from Statsig.


**Key Points:**

- User behavior is unpredictable: Users might initially react positively to a new feature but lose interest over time.

- External factors: Events outside your control, such as a global pandemic, can drastically alter user engagement and skew your experiment results.

- You then model these early signals against historical data of known long-term outcomes. This helps predict the eventual impact on retention.

- It's important to choose surrogate indexes wisely. They must have a proven correlation with the long-term outcome you care about.

- Engaged user biasmeans you're mostly hearing from your power users. They're not your average customer, so their feedback might lead you down a narrow path.

- Selective sampling issuesoccur when you only look at a subset of users. This might make you miss out on broader trends.

- Diversify your data sources: Don't rely solely on one type of user feedback. Look at a mix of both highly engaged users and those less active.

- Use stratified sampling: This means you'll divide your user base into smaller groups or strata based on characteristics like usage frequency. Then, sample evenly from these groups.

### 181. Demystifying identity resolution

**Date:** 2024-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/demystifying-identity-resolution


**Summary:**  
The notion of “identity resolution” in the SaaS world continues to be an elusive gold standard that businesses want to solve in order to understand the full scope of customer behaviors across all touch-points. Example: ## Example ID resolution scenarios
Scenario 1:An unknown user visits the website and gets assigned to the “Test” group fornav_v2experiment using via a deviceID.


**Key Points:**

- No technology providers will solve every use-case and scenario perfectly, though many will make bold claims. There is a ton of nuance here and no one-size-fits-all solution.

- It is strictly impossible to reliably identify a single human interacting anonymously on two different devices that never identify themselves.

- Unknown user identity becomes the crux of the challenge. When switching devices, browsers, environments (server vs. client), or clearing device storage, this ID will not persist.

- The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds.

- A few disclaimers, debunkings, and considerations as we dive in:

- Identity boundary basics

- What does this have to do with experimentation?

**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ad-blockers-feature-management-testing-tools


**Summary:**  
There are many browser extensions out there today available to web users that help them block pesky ads around the web.


**Key Points:**

- Statsig’s presence on the block lists is less than other providers at the time of writing this, likely due to the fact that we were founded more recently—but this could change!

### 191. Onboarding for growth with A/B tests

**Date:** 2023-08-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/onboarding-for-growth-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
For B2B SaaS applications, a user’s very first login or download experience has a significant influence on their engagement metrics. Example: Example experiment hypothesis: Tooltip pop-ups at every screen might empower users to progress through the onboarding workflow, thereby increasing the percentage of onboarding completions and subsequently active usage. The quicker you guide them to this revelation (decrease time-to-value), the more likely they are to become sticky, which significantly impacts core metrics such as daily active users (DAU) and ultimately retention and net recurring revenue (NRR).


**Key Points:**

- Incorporating contextual tooltips or pop-ups that empower users to navigate through the workflow (sometimes even including a brief autoplay tutorial)

- Highlighting specific high-value feature(s) that give early wins for users

- Featuring a “one-click quick start” or similar capability that automatically configures basic parameters for immediate use of features

- Offering different plans such as a free trial with limited features vs a premium trial with full access

- Personalizing messaging based on the user's persona such as their industry or role

- Offering discounts in the eleventh hour is not the growth strategy of champions.

- Successful onboarding-for-growth implementations

- Testing and identifying winning features

- Build your own in-house platform
Build your own in-house platform
- Fork an open-source platform and self-host it
Fork an open-source platform and self-host it
- Go buy a cloud solution
Go buy a cloud solution
This is a conversation I have often, and as a result, I have unique insight into what makes a good decision. Compare the functional needs, reliability, scalability, and costs of an in-house solution versus an external service to evaluate which may offer faster innovation.


**Key Points:**

- Build your own in-house platform

- Fork an open-source platform and self-host it

- You’re faced with a dilemma:

- In-house build vs. off-the-shelf solution

- There’s no such thing as free

### 193. Lessons from Notion: How to build a great AI product, if you&#39;re not an AI company

**Date:** 2023-06-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/notion-how-to-build-an-ai-product


**Summary:**  
Imagine that you’re the CEO of a successful documents company. You know it’s time to build an AI product. Example: With the rate at which the AI space is changing, there will be constant opportunities to improve the AI product by:
- Swapping out models (i.e., replacing GPT-3.5-turbo with GPT-4)
Swapping out models (i.e., replacing GPT-3.5-turbo with GPT-4)
- Creating a new, purpose-built model (i.e., taking an open-source model and training it for your application)

### 194. Online experimentation: The new paradigm for building AI applications

**Date:** 2023-04-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Palak Goel and Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-products-require-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:
First, product managers would come up with a new idea for a product and lay out a release timeline. Example: But the risks are palpable—for every AI success story, there’s an example of a biased model sharing misinformation, or a feature being pulled due to safety concerns. #### In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today.


**Key Points:**

- How can you launch and iterate on features quickly without compromising your existing user experience?

- How can you move fast while ensuring your apps are safe and reliable?

- How can you ensure that the features you launch lead to substantive, differentiated improvements in user outcomes?

- How can you identify the optimal prompts and models for your specific use case?

- Build compelling AI features that engage users

- Flight dozens of models, prompts and parameters in the ‘back end’ of these features

- Collect data on all inputs and outputs

- Use this data to select the best-performing variant and fine-tune new models

**Summary:**  
Within Statsig, we celebrate these increases when they are statistically significant with a deep, satisfying, green color:
## When up isn’t good
But what about when thisisn’tthe case? Example: ## Real-world example: Performance improvement
We ran into a case like this at Statsig when we ran an experiment to load content from the next page when your cursor hovers on the link, since you might visit there imminently.


**Key Points:**

- the count of crashes in your app

- removals of items from a shopping cart

### 197. The Importance of Design in B2B SaaS

**Date:** 2022-09-29T00:00-04:00  
**Author:** Geunbae &#34;GB&#34; Lee  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-importance-of-design-in-b2b-saas


**Summary:**  
The expectations of a delightful user experience—previously reserved for the realm of B2C products—have bled into B2B space as well, with enterprise customers expecting to be delighted by the look and feel of the products that they’re using. Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.


**Key Points:**

- A well-designed product is a strong foundation

- A well-designed product is your value prop, an edge vs. competitors

- A well-designed product helps your team to move faster

- A well-designed product is key in establishing your brand

- Suddenly, those attempts to make the product more powerful by adding increased functionality ironically end up weakening your product’s value proposition.

Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig
- Keep things consistent: We’ll treat your imported data just the same as SDK data, materializing into experiment results, creating tracking datasets, and eventually allowing you to explore it in tools like Events Explorer.


**Key Points:**

- Quick and easy set-up: Once you have your connection details on hand, it takes less than 5 minutes to get started

- Set it and forget it: We’ll take care of keeping import data in sync, and proactively look for and report any issues with your data in Statsig

- In your Statsig metrics page, you’ll be able to find the new “Ingestions” tab

- Here, you can give us connection information for one of the supported data warehouses

- You’ll give us a SQL snippet that provides a view for your base metric or event data. This can be as simple as aSELECT *from your existing table!

- In the console, you’ll be able to map your existing fields into Statsig fields

- Once that’s done you can preview the data we’ll pull, set an ingestion schedule, and optionally load some recent historical data to get started.

### 200. Understanding the role of the 95% confidence interval

**Date:** 2022-08-04T16:31:57.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/95-percent-confidence-interval


**Summary:**  
Yet its validity and usefulness is often questioned. Example: For example, startup companies that have a high risk tolerance will want to minimize false negatives by selecting lower confidence intervals (e.g., 80% or 90%). I’m a proponent of 95%confidence intervalsand recommend them as a solid default.


**Key Points:**

- A range of plausible values

- An indicator of how repeatable/stable our experimental method is

- It’s a reasonable low bar.In practice, it’s an achievable benchmark for most fields of research to remain productive.

- It’s ubiquitous.It ensures we’re all speaking the same language. What one team within your company considers significant is the same as another team.

- Set your confidence threshold BEFORE any data is collected. Cheaters change the confidence interval after there’s an opportunity to peek.

- Gelman, Andrew (Nov. 5, 2016).“Why I prefer 50% rather than 95% intervals”.

- Gelman, Andrew (Dec 28, 2017).“Stupid-ass statisticians don’t know what a goddam confidence interval is”.

**Summary:**  
Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear.”
… wroteC.S. Example: Three working principles that I rely on heavily:
- Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
Break down large projects/goals into small experiments, then double down on what works
- Make it trivial to test a change with a small section of users, and progressively expand the blast radius; for example, start by dog-fooding features with internal employees, then open up to a small group customers, say, who asked for the feature, then expand more broadly

### 203. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Example: For example, if you typed “#m lgtm” the bot would respond with the macro lgtm, an image of a doge saying looks good to me. A few main reasons:
- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.


**Key Points:**

- If you know the name of the macro you want to use, it’s a lot faster for you to type the name than to find the image on your computer each time you want to use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Within the Admin Panel -> Select Integrations -> Click Create custom integration

- Within Permissions, check “Group chat bot”, “Message any member”, and “Read all messages”

- You should get back a url that looks like this:http://71c8-216-207-142-218.ngrok.io. Input that as the callback url in the page webhook.

- Open uphttp://localhost:4040/in your browser. Here is where you can see requests sent and received by your webhook.

- Create a new Workplace group chat with your favorite coworkers and your bot, and trigger your bot by calling one of your macros such as “#m lgtm”

- Usehttp://localhost:4040/and console to debug as needed

**Summary:**  
A year ago on May 19th, 2021, I took a big leap of faith and departed my satisfying job at Facebook to join an early stage startup calledStatsig. To me, awell-defined design system is an essential building block(foundation)that will help us move and innovate faster.Without the Design System in place, it is difficult to maintain consistency while building quickly.


**Key Points:**

### 205. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
They’re trying several ideas at any given time. If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.


**Key Points:**

- Have a clear set of questions the holdout is designed to answer. This will guide your design, holdout duration, value you get and will dictate what costs make sense to incur.

- Understand the costs associated with holdouts. Make sure teams that will pay those costs understand holdout goals and buy in.

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Feature Level Holdouts

- Measuring Cumulative Impact

- If a new shopping app ships 10 features over a quarter, each showing a 2% increase in total revenue — it’s unlikely they’d see a 20% increase at the end of the quarter.

### 206. There’s More To Learn From Tests

**Date:** 2022-04-20T18:45:44.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts!) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way. Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.


**Key Points:**

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

- The target population is split randomly for a test, where some get the solution (Test) and some don’t (Control)

- Unrealized Value: Testing to Understand

- Don’t Waste Your Tests: Take Time to Think About The Results

- Parting Thoughts

- Example: There’s a great example of this providing value for a Statsig clienthere.

### 208. Modernizing the Customer Data Stack

**Date:** 2022-04-18T21:30:15.000Z  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/modernizing-the-customer-data-stack


**Summary:**  
There are two key factors influencing this rapid modernization:
- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.


**Key Points:**

- Businesses want to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and fresh information.

- Businesses want to leverage rapidly evolving and automated data intelligence inside their customer-facing applications.

- Websites, mobile applications and server side applications.

- If a business is generating calculated metrics, model outputs or cohorts in a warehouse, that ultimately becomes a data producer as well.

- Help desks, payment systems, marketing tools, A/B testing tools, ad platforms, CRMs, etc.

- Too many custom pipelines, SDKs and transformations decrease the fidelity and manageability of data over time.

- It’s impossible to enforce schema standardization across channels without introducing latency (Everyone loves a bolt onMDM… right?).

- It’s impossible to resolve user identities across channels without complex user identity services, which introduce latency.

**Summary:**  
While the sales team wrangled everyone around a Magic 8 Ball, Vijaye Raji (Founder & CEO) had his own April 1st surprise gated on the company’s website and he used Statsig’s own Feature Gates to test it out. Example: A common example (that Statsig’s website uses as well) isGDPRcookie consent for countries in the EU.


**Key Points:**

- Dogfooding new features to your company using Feature Gates

### 211. Democratizing Experimentation

**Date:** 2022-03-21T05:41:41.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/democratizing-experimentation


**Summary:**  
When building out instant games on Facebook a few years back, a new developer switched to use a newer version of an internal SDK. Example: (once measures turn into goals, it’s possible to incent behavior that’s undesirable unless we’re prudent; see theHanoi Rat Problemfor an interesting example)
Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want? A more experienced teammate noticed the change reduced time spent in the game.


**Key Points:**

- Is the metric movement explainable?

- Are all significant movements being reported, not just the positive ones?

- Are guardrail metrics being violated?

- Is there a quota we’re drawing from?

- Is the experiment driving the outcome we ultimately want?

- Guarding againstp-hacking (or selective reporting)(often by establishing guidelines like using ~14 day windows to report results over;see more about reading results safely here.)

- Amazon famously reduced distractions during checkout flows to improve conversion. This is a pattern that most ecommerce sites now optimize for.

- Experiment Review Best Practices

### 215. Introducing Autotune: Statsig’s Multiarmed Bandit

**Date:** 2022-02-03T20:33:11.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-autotune


**Summary:**  
MAB is a well-known probability problem that involves balancing exploration vs exploitation (Ref. Example: ### Case Study: A Real Autotune Test on statsig.com
Statsig’s website (www.statsig.com) showcases Statsig’s products and offerings. We provide a few parameters to play with, but for most use-cases you can use the defaults like we did:
- exploration window (default = 24 hrs) — The initial time that Autotune will evenly split traffic.


**Key Points:**

- Determining which product(s) to feature on a one-day Black Friday sale (resource = time, payout = revenue).

- Showing the best performing ad given a limited budget (resource = budget, payout = clicks/visits).

- Selecting the best signup flow given a finite amount of new users (resource = new users, payout = signups).

- Maximizing Gain:When resources are scarce and maximizing payoff is critical.

- Multiple Variations:Bandits are good at focusing traffic on the most promising variations. Bandits can be quite useful vs traditional A/B testing when there are >4 variations.

- winner threshold (default = 95%) — The confidence level Autotune will use to declare a winner and begin diverting 100% of traffic towards.

- statsig.logEvent(‘click’):Logs a successful click. This combined with getConfig() allows Autotune to compute the click-thru rate.

- Under an A/B/C/D test, 75% of the traffic would have been diverted to inferior variations (vs 42% for Autotune).

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/definitive-guide-ecommerce-growth


**Summary:**  
I’ve done it thrice, first with Flipkart, then with a company that I founded myself, then at Amazon. Example: For example, anA/B testfor checkout on the Vancouver Olympic Store showed that a single page checkout performed 21.8% better than the multi-step checkout. Large improvements deeper in the funnel require a smaller sample size to test and make every upstream step more effective.


**Key Points:**

- E-commerce is hard.

- 1. Optimizing Conversion Rate

- Crushing the Gloom of Cart Abandonment

- Lighting-up Add-to-Cart Conversions

- 2. Growing Visitors

- Content is Central

- Double Down by Targeting

**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in. Example: For example, our JavaScript client SDK is only12kb minified + Gzipped. #### At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

- 1. Serves a single user at a time

### 225. Embrace Overlapping A/B Tests and Avoid the Dangers of Isolating Experiments

**Date:** 2021-10-08T06:44:42.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/embracing-overlapping-a-b-tests-and-the-danger-of-isolating-experiments


**Summary:**  
How to handle simultaneous experiments frequently comes up. Example: For example, one cannot test new ranking algorithm A (vs control) and also new ranking algorithm B (vs control) in overlapping tests. This method maintains experimental power, but can reduce accuracy (as I’ll explain later, this is not a major drawback).


**Key Points:**

- Isolated tests— Users are split into segments, and each user is enrolled in only one experiment. Your experimental power is reduced, but accuracy of results are maintained.

- Microsoft’s Online Controlled Experiments At Scale

- How Google Conducts More experiments

- Can You Run Multiple AB Tests At The Same Time?

- Large Scale Experimentation at Spotify

- Running Multiple A/B Tests at The Same Time: Do’s and Dont’s

- AtStatsig, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting many experimentalists from different backgrounds and experiences.

**Date:** 2021-09-24T00:26:47.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-conversion-in-e-commerce


**Summary:**  
Today, I want to share an inside look into experimentation at a popular financial services company that offers payment processing services and APIs for e-commerce applications¹. Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:
- Checkout: The buyer-facing widget optimizes the order of the checkout page to drive the highest conversion experience. This naturally focuses a lot of the company’s efforts on improving conversion in multiple ways.


**Key Points:**

- How experimentation moves the numbers in a popular payment processing company

- Experimentation is core to product development

- Experimentation with a smaller user base

- Choosing the right metrics

- All in on Experimentation

- Example: For example, their core product optimizes for conversion in two ways:

### 233. My Five Favorite Things About Swift

**Date:** 2021-05-11T07:20:26.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/my-five-favorite-things-about-swift


**Summary:**  
I started doing iOS development at Facebook, which only used Objective-C for its iOS apps. Example: For example, instead of concatenating strings like this:
NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;
NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;
NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];
we can now do this:
let firstMsg = “Concatenating strings in Swift “
let secondMsg = “is EAZY”
let fullMsg = firstMsg + secondMsg
### 2. #### Statsigstrives to empower all developers to ship features faster, so naturally one of the first milestones for us was to provide an SDK for iOS development.


**Key Points:**

- optional parameters and labels

- 1. Swift is much more readable

- 2. Swift supports modern language features

- 3. No more header files!

- 4. Some nice quirks that I didn’t know I wanted

- 5. Easy to port to Objective-C

- Example: For example, instead of concatenating strings like this:
NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;
NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;
NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];
we can now do this:
let firstMsg = “Concatenating strings in Swift “
let secondMsg = “is EAZY”
let fullMsg = firstMsg + secondMsg

**Author:** Rodrigo Roim  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ruid-time-travel-safe-distributed-unique-64-bit-ids-generated-in-rust


**Summary:**  
AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration. - Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.


**Key Points:**

- 41 bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- 14 bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- 9 bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

- Defining a millisecond maximum time travel thresholdMMTTT(sometimes shortened asM2T3).

- Comparing the current generation timestampCtwith the previous generation timestampPt. WhenCt < Ct + MMTTT < Pt, RUIDs are generated withPtas the timestamp.

- Sleeping forMMTTTwhen the server starts, and validating the system clock indeed increased by at leastMMTTTat the end.

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

- Should you use it?
