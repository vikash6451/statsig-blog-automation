### 2. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong: Navigating multiple comparison corrections in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparison-corrections-in-a-b


**Summary:**  
In the world of A/B testing, one common challenge is the issue of multiple comparisons. This occurs when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted simultaneously, whether it’s peeking at the data during the experiment, examining several key performance indicators (KPIs), or analyzing different segments of the population. In a previous blog, we explored in detail therisks of inflating false positives (alpha) in these situations


**Key Points:**

- Behind the scenes: What is the core difference between correction methods?

- Solutions for multiple comparisons

- The BH procedure works as follows:

- Rank all p-values in ascending order.

**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
AI is changing how we build software. With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. As teams embed AI deeper into their products, and they're facing a new challenge


**Key Points:**

- AI is changing how we build software.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

- AI breaks this model in two critical ways:

- Today, AI products operate in open-ended domains where "correct" has infinite variations and context matters more than accuracy.

- Teams are operating without the foundation they used to rely on: the ability to rigorously test software in a non-production environment.

**Date:** 2025-07-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
The problem of multiple comparisons represents a fundamental clash between statistical inference and human intuition. After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results. The goal of this blog is to explain why our intuition leads us astray in this case and to clarify the multiple comparisons problem


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- Figure 1.Probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (alpha) as a function of the number of tests.

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it. You may choose the correct statistical method for your test, carefully plan the sample size needed to achieve adequate power, and thoroughly confirm that your assumptions are met, but none of these efforts will be worth it if your samples are not random


**Key Points:**

- Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it?

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

### 15. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools. Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift. With your current traffic, that meanseleven weeksof waiting to gather enough user data


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights. However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. This approach creates a bottleneck, delaying the launch of new experiments until the ongoing one is completed


**Key Points:**

- In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights.

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- The illustration below outlines two possible scenarios for this kind of test:

**Summary:**  
A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset. The world of A/B testing is brutal. Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time


**Key Points:**

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- These mindset principles are what I believe separate the best A/B testers from the rest.

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
When we first started Statsig, we had one infra engineer and a highly manual process. Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. You know that meme: “If your infra dev got hit by a bus, would your company survive


**Key Points:**

- The answer was yes, but it took a lot of clever design decisions and tooling.

- You can think of this process in three main phases. We’ll walk through each in detail, but in a nutshell:

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

### 20. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now. When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%


**Key Points:**

- Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now.

- Introducing Fieller intervals in Statsig

- What's the difference between Fieller intervals and the Delta Method?

- How are Fieller intervals calculated?

- Determine if a Fieller interval is well-defined

**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them. After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. The challenge of proving value
When I joined Statsig as PM for our SDKs team, I faced a daunting reality: much of my engineering team had been th


**Key Points:**

- The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them.

- This fear isn't unique to me. I've seen it repeatedly in conversations with other PMs, including many of our customers.

- The natural response to this anxiety is to try to prove your worth through control.

- The two paths for product leaders

- When facing this credibility gap, product managers typically choose between two paths:

**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale. Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Namely, “How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale


**Key Points:**

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- At a high-level, our solution works by replicating the user-property updates in Bigtable into a Type 2 SCD BigQuery table. Here’s how it works:

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture. When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. My metrics-focused foundation
My tech career began as a Growth Manager at Rupeek, a Series-A fintech startup in India


**Key Points:**

- The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture.

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- This revealed the true PM dilemma: It's easy to say 'focus on outcomes', but much harder to identify which outcomes matter.

- This created three key problems:

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 25. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
The distinction between “do no harm” and “do good” goals significantly impacts the type of test you choose and the likelihood of obtaining a meaningful result. Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- Here are some situations where non-inferiority testing can be particularly relevant:

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

**Summary:**  
Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management. After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. The pressure to get it perfect
As a data scientist at Uber, I enjoyed the process of building a deep understanding of the products I worked on: analyzing data, presenting insights and making r


**Key Points:**

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

- While I was confident in my product strategy, the root of the issue washow I approached execution.

- By polishing a "perfect" plan before involving senior stakeholders, I created two critical problems:

- What I should have done was ship thin slices early:releaseminimal viable productsthat tested core hypotheses andgenerated real user feedback.

- By getting something tangible in front of users and stakeholders quickly, PMs can:

### 27. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
You don’t need to wait a year to know if your feature worked—surrogate metrics let you move fastandstay anchored to long-term outcomes that actually matter. Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. If you bring the predicted values and mean squared error (MSE) of the model used to make these predictions, we’ll accurately account for the model’s prediction error when calculating p-values and confidence intervals


**Key Points:**

- Why are surrogate metrics helpful?

- Surrogate metric best practices

- Validate your predictive model and monitor over time

- General Modeling Best Practices:

- More resources on modeling best practices:

**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
Product development used to be an art. A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. That simply doesn’t cut it today


**Key Points:**

- Product development used to be an art.

- With this investment, we’re doubling down on our mission to help every product team embrace the science of building great products.

- Building products today can get messy. Why?

- Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.

- Large teams create misalignment:Multiple stakeholders, disjointed workflows, and scattered data lead to endless debates instead of decisive action.

**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact. Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics


**Key Points:**

- Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact.

- When are Release Pipelines used?

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

### 32. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands
For a startup shipping one feature a month, an A/B test is a neat side project. At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude


**Key Points:**

- Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands

- Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude.

- Coverage: What fraction of product change is truly tested?

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

### 34. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them. At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Every new server-side feature meant copying and pasting evaluation logic into 10 repos, wrangling language quirks, and fighting version drift


**Key Points:**

- If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them.

- With this change, we're now seeingup to 5x evaluation speeds(!)—and that's just the cherry on top of all the code sustainability benefits.

- Figure 1:In our legacy model, every new server-side feature required duplicating evaluation logic code in all 10 server SDKs.

- Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:

- We used the following FFIs (Foreign Function Interfaces) for this Rust core project:

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
If you’d told me a decade ago that software teams would someday run more experiments than marketing, I’d have assumed you were joking—or pitching a dystopian adtech startup. Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. ThinkOptimizely's founding story—testing every piece of marketing in the Obama presidential campaign

### 38. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As an outsider to the SEO world, I'd always seen it as a world of convention: add your meta descriptions, set your canonicals, write something novel, and the traffic will come. It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Certainly, all of the above (metas, canonicals, novel content) are best practices—but if they're well-known principles, can they really se


**Key Points:**

- How can the algorithm—and its many rules—allow you to AB test like you normally would?

- First, and perhaps obviously, we have to follow the rules of the algorithm.

- For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:

- On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-ab-testing-is-ultimately-qualitative


**Summary:**  
A/B testing is essential for data-driven teams, but its real value isn’t just in the metrics—it’s in the ultimately qualitative decisions that those metrics enable. Understanding the bigger picture
Real-world decision-making doesn’t happen in a statistical vacuum. People with diverse perspectives have to debate options in a room, weighing pros and cons between multiple (sometimes conflicting) objectives, many of which can't be captured in a single metric


**Key Points:**

- Understanding the bigger picture

- The limitations of data and the role of expert judgment

- A balanced approach: Numbers and narrative

- Talk to the pros, become a proWe're on standby to help you start using your data to make better decisions.Let's chat

### 46. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As A/B testing analysts, we often encounter skewed distributions for our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), especially when dealing with revenue metrics. It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

### 48. Designing controlled experiments to test correlated metrics

**Date:** 2025-03-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/designing-controlled-experiments-correlated-metrics


**Summary:**  
What are correlated metrics. Correlationoccurs when there is a relationship between the values of some variable with the values of some other bariable. This is contrasted byindependence, where there is no relationship between the values of two variables


**Key Points:**

- Correlated metrics in an experiment

- In an experimental context, you might care about several different types of correlated metrics:

- These all can serve different functions in an experiment

- Note that usage of Surrogate Metrics also requires for prediction error to be accounted for in reading experimental restuls.

### 49. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another. When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Traditional per-user randomization often creates “cross-group contamination,” where one side of the marketplace in treatment interacts with another side in control


**Key Points:**

- A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another.

- Cluster-based randomization

- Switchback testing

- Phased Rollouts

- Weighted randomization (multi-armed bandits)

### 51. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. Bayesian alternatives promise more intuitive “probability of being better” metrics and flexible sequential monitoring


**Key Points:**

- Introduction

- This paper distinguishes two broad ways in which “informedness” can be brought into Bayesian A/B testing:

- Therefore, in applications, we should be careful about the misuse of Bayesian without understanding their misuse:

- Our goal is to clarify these trade-offs and suggest ways to harness Bayesian methods responsibly. For such purposes, we recommend two approaches:

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

### 54. Why data-driven marketing attribution models don&#39;t work as promised

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/data-driven-marketing-attribution-shortcomings


**Summary:**  
From huge enterprises to niche e-commerce brands, every marketer grapples with the same fundamental question: Where should we invest our marketing budget for the greatest return. Ideally, you’d like a tidy calculation that says, “Channel A accounts for 25% of conversions, Channel B for 40%, Channel C for 10%,” and so on. That’s the allure of marketing attribution: pinpointing exactly which touchpoints move the needle and which are mere distractions


**Key Points:**

- The problem: Evaluating marketing spend in a complex landscape

- What data-driven models promise

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

### 65. How Statsig uses query-level experiments to speed up Metrics Explorer

**Date:** 2025-02-20T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Nicole Smith  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/query-level-experiments-metrics-explorer


**Summary:**  
Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes. Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. This is a super common challenge for B2B companies: a professional user base means that behaviors are pretty static and there isn’t the same scale of users that Google or Facebook have to detect small effects


**Key Points:**

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- There are a few reasons why running an experiment can be helpful here in particular:

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

- IF we just use a CTE instead of a creating a temp table

### 81. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment. However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Issues like website crashes when serving the control version could prevent the SDK from sending exposure events to Statsig.

- However, these tools have been limited to analyzing a preset list of dimensions, such assdk_type,browser,country, andos.

- Step 1:In your project settings, list the custom dimensions you want to analyze.

- Step 2:Navigate to the Diagnostics tab and open the Experiment Health Checks.

**Author:** Sam Miller  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-config-propagation-time-with-target-apps


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we’re constantly finding ways to drive down what we call config propagation latency. Propagation latency is defined as the time it takes for a change made in the Console to be reflected by the config checks you issue on your frontend or backend systems with our SDKs. Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we’re constantly finding ways to drive down what we call config propagation latency.

- Target apps are an advanced feature that helps manage which configurations are delivered to specific SDK instances or services.

- The benefits of using target apps are very straightforward:

- The optimization is centered around a new in-memory cache that pre-filters configurations based on the target app. Here's how it works:

- As your integration with Statsig scales, consider adopting target apps to improve performance.

### 113. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products. In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms


**Key Points:**

- Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products.

- Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms.

- Based on this,I was initially fairly cynical about funnels. It’s true that funnels do have some fundamental limitations:

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-plan-test-duration-cuped


**Summary:**  
Picture this: You're planning an experiment and are well-versed in concepts like Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE), significance level, statistical power, and sample size determination. You understand that failing to plan the test duration can lead to underpowered tests and inflated false positive rates due to peeking. Recently, you've been introduced toCUPED, an advanced statistical method that reduces KPI variance, resulting in more sensitive tests (lower MDE) or shorter test durations (lower sa


**Key Points:**

- If this description fits you, you’re in the right place 😊

- What is test planning and why is it important?

- What is CUPED and why is it important?

- The variance of \(\overline{Y}_{\text{CUPED}}\) is reduced by the square of the Pearson correlation between \(\overline{X}\) and \(\overline{Y}\):

- In reality, we don't know the true values of the variables, so we must estimate them.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-allies-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
For much of my career in data science, I had a sort of shared understanding with my colleagues that the worst part of the job is dealing with a constant deluge of questions. These questions range from the actually problematic (a stakeholder asking if you can do a drill down to find a “win” in their experiment results) to great questions that just require some mental bandwidth to answer well and randomize you from the work you were planning on doing. In my two years at Statsig, I’ve totally chang


**Key Points:**

- The stakeholders I’m usually working with at Statsig don’t work at Statsig.

- This, funnily enough, leads to a reinforcing loop; as we demonstrate a willingness to collaborate, people have more product asks. This is agoodthing.

- Introducing Product AnalyticsLearn how leading companies stay on top of every metric as they roll out features.Read more

- When I see a customer question more than once, this is a near-instant trigger for me to update documentation and reach out to the design team.

- This has been especially important as part of theStatsig Warehouse Nativeteam’s process since we’re tightly integrating with customers’ data layer!

### 209. Switchback experiments: Overview and considerations

**Date:** 2023-11-14T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/switchback-experiments


**Summary:**  
When should someone use a switchback test instead of an A/B test. Switchback experiments are a way to measure the impact of a change when network effects render traditional A/B tests impractical, as is often the case in 2-sided marketplace products. A canonical example of this scenario comes from ridesharing services likeLyft: All the riders in an area share the same supply of drivers, and vice versa


**Key Points:**

- When should someone use a switchback test instead of an A/B test?

- Since the test and control groups are not independent, a simple A/B test will produce inaccurate results.

- Questions about switchback testing?

- At the most basic level, the minimum requirement for setting up a switchback experiment is determining the time interval for switching.

- The standard t-test commonly used for traditional A/B tests is not recommended for switchback. experiments:

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statbot-ai-manual-tasks-hackathon


**Summary:**  
I’m not really a “manual labor” guy…
Not to say I won’t rake some leaves, build a desk, orsplice buttons onto my PS5 controller. I’m talking aboutcopying and pasting, rephrasing, categorizing, and other tedious, manual tasks. There’s a tired old trope about howAI is not good enough to "replace people


**Key Points:**

- I’m not really a “manual labor” guy…

- AI assists me with the manual labor I so dread—the tasks that make me feel less like a marketer and more likean LLMmyself.

- Statsig is full of help. Ourwebsite documentationis comprehensive and includeswalkthroughs and guideson tons of relevant topics:

- But in terms of prioritization,writing a glossary would take weeks, and there are much better things to spend that time on…

- Foundation model:Determines which GPT model is used to generate responses. GPT-4 is great for readability.

"Let’s use a coin toss to decide—first to 50 wins. "
Imagine we’re flipping a fair coin several times and get 8 heads and 2 tails. (A fair coin is a balanced one, and has never been used in a magician’s routine


**Key Points:**

- Sample ratio mismatch is evidence of selection bias

- Points to an implementation issue

- This won’t happen if you’re using Statsig because our SDK filters out ineligible users evenly across all experiment groups

- Data processing issues:there may be some process by which this data is being deleted or duplicated for only the control or test variant.

- If you’re sending all your data through Statsig, we do the data processing and there shouldn’t be SRM coming from data processing

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cumulative-impact-experimentation-wins


**Summary:**  
You don’t experiment for wins
In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:
This FOMO-engendering content has a point. Experimentation is a valuable tool for understanding what kind of changes work for your product; with that knowledge in hand, you can more reliably pick a good future direction. However, in practice—and especially in product experimentation—the real wins come from not losing


**Key Points:**

- In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:

- Chasing rainbows: The illusion of the big win

- The unpalatable truth is that these victories aren’t common, and are frequently incorrect. There are a number of contributing factors:

- A penny saved is a penny earned

- Product owners use the product differently than the typical user, which skews their intuition and causes them to design unhelpful features

**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-vs-buy-feature-flags-gates-experiment-platform


**Summary:**  
In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig. I’ve observed some patterns and developed some standard questions that I ask these customers, which I think objectively helps them begin to understand which of the build and/or buy options is right for them. Longer term I plan to create a calculator or survey that can help people understand which option they should prioritize, but in the meantime I want to share


**Key Points:**

- In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig.

- Building an experimentation platform requires specialized engineering, data science and data engineering skills and resources.

- Have your team members built similar systems before?

- The 95% confidence interval currently dominates online and scientific experimentation; it always has.

- What is a 95% confidence interval?

- An indicator of how repeatable/stable our experimental method is

- An indicator of how repeatable/stable our experimental method is

- Why 95% confidence intervals are useful cutoffs

### 247. CUPED on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-07-07T21:55:42.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Run experiments with more speed and accuracy
We’re pleased to announce the rollout of CUPED for all our customers. Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics. This gives you access to a powerful experiment tool being used at top tech companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Airbnb and more


**Key Points:**

- Now the results will reflect the reality that this experiment drove an increase for users in the test group!

- We’ll be monitoring this as it rolls out to understand how effective this is and if there’s any next steps we can take to level up our approach.

- Sample Size / Variance Reduction

- The effectiveness of CUPED varies across user populations and metrics. It’s worth knowing what to look for!

### 248. Leading a team of lions

**Date:** 2022-06-16T22:03:45.000Z  
**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/leading-a-team-of-lions


**Summary:**  
Training your team to make independent decisions
“It was like the debate of a group of savages as to how to extract a screw from a piece of wood. Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear


**Key Points:**

- Training your team to make independent decisions

- People who are right a lot, they listen a lot, and people who are right a lot, change their mind a lot.

- People who are right seek to dis-confirm their most profoundly-held convictions, which is very unnatural for humans.

- Jeff Bezos

- I wish more folks shared how they train their teams and operationalize independent decision making. Here’s my short list.

### 249. Why do my Facebook Groups look different?

**Date:** 2022-06-14T20:58:00.000Z  
**Author:** Tore Hanssen  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-do-my-facebook-groups-look-different


**Summary:**  
By now, most people realize that when they open Facebook or Instagram on their phone, their experience is very different than the person next to them. It goes deeper than just the content that you see, and the ranking algorithms backings those — the buttons you have to click, the way a post with multiple photos shows up, or even theshade of the bluemight be different. At Statsig, we’ve been working to help any company run these same types of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Trying to experiment on a different unit type than a “user”? Or just miss GK::forID()?Try out customIDs on Statsig.

### 251. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool. The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Within Workplace, all you had to do was type #m followed by the name of your macro and the macro bot would respond to your comment or message with the macro associated with that name


**Key Points:**

- One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool.

- But why have a dedicated tool instead of sending the image yourself each time? A few main reasons:

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Create a Custom Integration within Workplace

### 253. Using Pulse Time Series for Deeper Insights

**Date:** 2022-05-16T19:35:15.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/using-pulse-time-series-for-deeper-insights


**Summary:**  
TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment. Sometimes, a brief scan of the color coded score card is enough to validate that all metrics behave as expected, and we quickly proceed with the launch. Other times, however, a more detailed understanding is required before deciding on next steps


**Key Points:**

- TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment.

- Does my experiment have a novelty effect? Do users try out the new feature once and never again?

- Is there pre-experiment bias in this metric? Was that lift there even before we launched the feature?

- This view shows the metric impact on each calendar day without aggregating days together. It’s a good one to check if we have concerns such as:

- Does the feature have a different impact on weekends vs. weekdays?

**Summary:**  
A Bayesian exploration of road rage methodology, and its important applications to experimentation
Disclaimer: this is in good fun and I don’t advocate road rage. You, dear reader, are driving somewhere nice. However, the driver behind you is determined to make you have a bad day; they’ve come up uncomfortably close behind you and you’re pretty sure they’re a bad driver who should feel bad about how they’re driving


**Key Points:**

- A Bayesian exploration of road rage methodology, and its important applications to experimentation

- Disclaimer: this is in good fun and I don’t advocate road rage.

- Soon, they pass you, and the age-old question rings through your brain:

- Do I need to let this person know that they’re a jerk?

- The decision above is of course a personal one, but it does have some interesting inputs.

### 255. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
An opinionated guide on using Holdouts
Feature Level Holdouts
Good teams move fast. They’re trying several ideas at any given time. When they find something that works, they ship it and find the next idea to try


**Key Points:**

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Engineering overhead. For each feature you ship with a holdout, you’re committing to support an if-then-else fork in your code. For a fast moving team, having to support multiple code paths makes the test and debug matrix large. Shorter holdouts help make this manageable. When your legacy code path breaks — if you don’t find and fix it swiftly, your holdout results become untrustworthy.

- Opportunity cost. When you ship features that increase revenue or retention, a large holdout means leaving those gains on the table. There’s also dissatisfaction you cause when someone sees a friend with a shiny new feature that they don’t have.

- Monitoring. Holdouts are typically analyzed in detail only at the end of the holdout period. It’s useful to check in on them at a regular cadence (e.g. monthly) to make sure there isn’t anything unexpected that may taint the holdout. A broken control variant impacting only 1% of your users can make the Holdout useless if you only detect it at the end of the holdout period. There’s little point comparing metrics between users with new features and users with a broken experience. The act of checking the performance of the Holdout group can spawn investigations to understand unexpected movements.

- Users, Customer Support & Marketing.For people in the holdout, it is confusing to see friends get a spiffy new feature, while you don’t. It’s important to retire and create new holdouts every cycle — so it’s not the same set of users punished again and again.

### 256. There’s More To Learn From Tests

**Date:** 2022-04-20T18:45:44.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts. ) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way


**Key Points:**

- The Standard: Pre-Launch Experimentation

- It’s common that when people think about testing, they mostly think about pre-launch experimentation:

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

- Unknowingly shipping bad experiments can be terrible. They’ll stick around and may negate the wins from ten good experiments!

- Experiment kick off

- Evaluating the hypothesis

- Critique/Reviews

**Summary:**  
The tools that make our jobs possible
When my co-workerSami Springmanand I joined Statsig, we both came from Snowflake- a mature sales organization with every bizdev tool you could dream of. As the first sales people at Statsig, we’ve been building our biztech stack from zero. After some trial and error, we have a list of 4 tools wecan’t live without


**Key Points:**

- The tools that make our jobs possible

- To be totally candid, without Sales Navigator, my job would benext-to-impossible.

- Most of the outbound business we source is either directly through LinkedIn, or from Zoominfo phone numbers/ emails.

- The only caveat for Outreach- the tool is less useful for account execs who aren’t making many cold calls + bulk emails.

- For younger orgs without published contact info, Seamless has been very helpful.

### 265. Reading Experimentation Tea Leaves

**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/reading-experimentation-tea-leaves


**Summary:**  
Making experiment readouts trustworthy
As we talk to many customers, one thing is clear: many common beliefs for product experimentation are plain wrong. These are often theoretical, academic and outdated. They lead teams to believe in a false sense of precision and waste months waiting on a handful of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Making experiment readouts trustworthy

- With great power though comes great responsibility

- You can also useholdouts and backteststo measure the cumulative impact of features over a longer period of time.

- A few tips to make sure you’re not reacting to noise -

- Have a hypothesis on the change you’re making (and expected impact). If you’re rolling out a bug fix to the video player in the Facebook app and see a small reduction in new user signups, it’s unlikely your bug fix is causing that. But if you are seeing an increase in video watch time, then you can usually be sure your fix is working as intended. Many practitioners apply a 95% confidence interval to metrics they’re expecting impact on, and use a 99% confidence interval on other metrics.

### 267. Failing fast, or How I learned to kiss a lot of frogs

**Date:** 2022-02-09T01:43:22.000Z  
**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/failing-fast-kiss-a-lot-of-frogs


**Summary:**  
Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast. In a startup, everybody builds stuff (code, websites, sales lists, etc) — and part of the building process is accepting that not everything you make is good. But, switching from outcome to learning-oriented can speed up productivity, and make it easier to identify good ideas


**Key Points:**

- Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast.

- But, this is when I learned the value of minimum viable products (MVPs).

Every feature is well-intentioned… that’s why we build them. However, our experience is less than a third create positive impact. Another third of the features require iteration before they land the desired impact — users might not discover it or are confused by it


**Key Points:**

- Every feature is well intentioned but…

- Tavouris an app that helps fill your fridge with unique, craft beers you can’t find locally. They use Statsig to manage features and run experiments.

- Tavour decided to tweak the feature to let users see more auto complete suggestions without having to scroll.

- The revised feature increased new user activation rate, giving them the confidence to finish rolling out this feature!

**Summary:**  
I worked on Facebook News Feed before I joined Statsig, and that’s where I learned about the value of experimentation. The culture in News Feed wasn’t just to use experiments to verify that our intuitions about what changes may lead to improvements were true. We also used experiments much like any good scientist would to understand more about their field—we started with a question, formed a hypothesis, and then went about constructing an experiment that would allow us to test our hypothesis and 


**Key Points:**

- I worked on Facebook News Feed before I joined Statsig, and that’s where I learned about the value of experimentation.

- Here’s an example of this method in action.

**Summary:**  
In the summer of 2021, HBO accidentally sent an email to millions of past and current subscribers with the body “This message is used by integration tests only”. The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments. For continuous deployment, teams often create environments for development, staging and production


**Key Points:**

- The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments.

- Two philosophies : Per Environment Config vs Global Config

- Some advantages of the Global Config approach (with environment specific exceptions) include…

- This is useful in production where stability is paramount, but can slow down iteration in development and staging environments.

**Summary:**  
Challenging prevailing narratives
You’re tasked with deciding where to go for dinner with your friends. You whip out your phone, fire up Yelp, and scroll through nearby restaurants. Piling on some filters, you settle on an option that looks good


**Key Points:**

- Challenging prevailing narratives

- Decision makers look for the first workable option they can find, not the best option.

- In search of the best narrative

- Challenging the reference narrative

### 280. How Statsig Designs SDKs for Different Application Environments

**Date:** 2021-10-22T05:10:07.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence. An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in. Specifically, we design any SDK for either client-side or server-side applications


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

### 281. Sales development hacks

**Date:** 2021-10-20T02:14:39.000Z  
**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
Sales is all about process. I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel


**Key Points:**

- Nail your pitch

- I pitch to my mom. If she doesn’t understand it, I still have work to do.

- For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”

- Don’t reinvent the wheel

- Spend the 10 minutes to build out a great email, save it, andmake sure you never write that email again.

### 282. User-Level vs. Device-Level Experiments with Statsig

**Date:** 2021-10-15T03:47:36.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/user-level-vs-device-level-experiments


**Summary:**  
A common challenge in A/B testing arises when we want to track customers from logged-out to logged-in states. Consider, for example, testing a new variant of the account creation flow. This begins with logged-out customers, but we also want to monitor key metrics and events once they complete the flow and log in


**Key Points:**

- Comparing key metrics across test and control groups requires joining 2 different sets of logs: Exposures and events.

- Exposures:Every time we run a check to determine which experience is delivered to a user (e.g.: test or control), we create a log containing:

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Group: The experiment group they were placed in

### 302. My Five Favorite Things About Swift

**Date:** 2021-05-11T07:20:26.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/my-five-favorite-things-about-swift


**Summary:**  
Statsigstrives to empower all developers to ship features faster, so naturally one of the first milestones for us was to provide an SDK for iOS development. I started doing iOS development at Facebook, which only used Objective-C for its iOS apps. But given Swift’s growing popularity (Apple’s own adoption has been growing quickly), we decided to offer and write our SDK natively in Swift


**Key Points:**

- Swift is much more readable

- NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;

- NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;

- NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];

- Swift supports modern language features

**Author:** Rodrigo Roim  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ruid-time-travel-safe-distributed-unique-64-bit-ids-generated-in-rust


**Summary:**  
RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust
RUIDs (Rodrigo’s Unique Identifiers) are 64 bit ids mathematically guaranteed to be unique when generated within the sameRUID root. Check it out on GitHub. AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration


**Key Points:**

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

- The canonical version of RUIDs (this repo) uses 41 bits for timestamp, 14 bits for a monotonically increasing sequence, and 9 bits for the root id.

- bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/pitfalls-of-multi-arm-experiments


**Summary:**  
Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups
As companies become more comfortable with running AB tests, they often consider simultaneously testing more than one variation. It’s called a multi-arm experiment, also known as multi-group and A/B/n (ABn) testing (but should not be confused withmulti-armed bandit experiments, hopefully the topic of a later blog post). Multi-arm testing involves two or more test groups (eg


**Key Points:**

- Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups

- Significance is Much More Significant

- Solution #1: Apply a Bonferroni correction

- The Bonferroni correction is risk-adverse solution that errs on avoiding Type I errors at the expense of Type II errors.

- Solution #2: Repeat your experiment

### 309. Why we started Statsig

**Date:** 2021-03-17T08:33:11.000Z  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-we-started-statsig


**Summary:**  
When I joined Facebook, one of the things that surprised me was the autonomy Engineers had in building new products and features, and how this enabled them to move really fast. I was curious how decisions were made around product features, since based on my previous experience, the bulk of the time sink happened inside conference rooms — where experienced engineers and PMs debated the details, made decisions, and wrote design docs, all before the first line of code was even written. Product deve


**Key Points:**

- Product development at Facebook often started with the germ of an idea which was quickly translated into code.

- If people wrote code right away, how did they make sure they were building features users actually wanted?

- Gatekeeper:Allows developers to build features visible only to a targeted set of users. For example, these could bedogfoodersand testers until a feature is ready for public consumption. Engineers will then open it up to a small user base to validate everything is working well before launching to the world.

- And the biggest peace-of-mind comes from knowing that when something goes really wrong at any point,you can easily turn features off in real-time.

- Quick Experiments (A/B):This tool takes the debates out of conference rooms and puts hypotheses to test in production. Instead of endless discussions about the “perfect” design, the amount of flexibility to provide, the corner cases to cover, engineers quickly code up different variants and put them out in front of users. How users interact with the product gives rich insights into what works and what doesn’t.

### 12. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
AI is changing how we build software. With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. As teams embed AI deeper into their products, and they're facing a new challenge


**Key Points:**

- AI is changing how we build software.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

- AI breaks this model in two critical ways:

- Today, AI products operate in open-ended domains where "correct" has infinite variations and context matters more than accuracy.

- Teams are operating without the foundation they used to rely on: the ability to rigorously test software in a non-production environment.

### 13. The more the merrier? The problem of multiple comparisons in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-07-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
The problem of multiple comparisons represents a fundamental clash between statistical inference and human intuition. After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results. The goal of this blog is to explain why our intuition leads us astray in this case and to clarify the multiple comparisons problem


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- Figure 1.Probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (alpha) as a function of the number of tests.

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it. You may choose the correct statistical method for your test, carefully plan the sample size needed to achieve adequate power, and thoroughly confirm that your assumptions are met, but none of these efforts will be worth it if your samples are not random


**Key Points:**

- Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it?

- Why is randomization important?

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools. Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift. With your current traffic, that meanseleven weeksof waiting to gather enough user data


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights. However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. This approach creates a bottleneck, delaying the launch of new experiments until the ongoing one is completed


**Key Points:**

- In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights.

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- The illustration below outlines two possible scenarios for this kind of test:

**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
When we first started Statsig, we had one infra engineer and a highly manual process. Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. You know that meme: “If your infra dev got hit by a bus, would your company survive


**Key Points:**

- The answer was yes, but it took a lot of clever design decisions and tooling.

- You can think of this process in three main phases. We’ll walk through each in detail, but in a nutshell:

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

### 20. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now. When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%


**Key Points:**

- Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now.

- Introducing Fieller intervals in Statsig

- What's the difference between Fieller intervals and the Delta Method?

- How are Fieller intervals calculated?

- Determine if a Fieller interval is well-defined

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale. Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Namely, “How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale


**Key Points:**

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- At a high-level, our solution works by replicating the user-property updates in Bigtable into a Type 2 SCD BigQuery table. Here’s how it works:

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture. When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. My metrics-focused foundation
My tech career began as a Growth Manager at Rupeek, a Series-A fintech startup in India


**Key Points:**

- The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture.

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- This revealed the true PM dilemma: It's easy to say 'focus on outcomes', but much harder to identify which outcomes matter.

- This created three key problems:

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 25. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
The distinction between “do no harm” and “do good” goals significantly impacts the type of test you choose and the likelihood of obtaining a meaningful result. Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- Here are some situations where non-inferiority testing can be particularly relevant:

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

As a data scientist at Uber, I enjoyed the process of building a deep understanding of the products I worked on: analyzing data, presenting insights and making r


**Key Points:**

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

- While I was confident in my product strategy, the root of the issue washow I approached execution.

- By polishing a "perfect" plan before involving senior stakeholders, I created two critical problems:

- What I should have done was ship thin slices early:releaseminimal viable productsthat tested core hypotheses andgenerated real user feedback.

- By getting something tangible in front of users and stakeholders quickly, PMs can:

### 27. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
You don’t need to wait a year to know if your feature worked—surrogate metrics let you move fastandstay anchored to long-term outcomes that actually matter. Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. If you bring the predicted values and mean squared error (MSE) of the model used to make these predictions, we’ll accurately account for the model’s prediction error when calculating p-values and confidence intervals


**Key Points:**

- Why are surrogate metrics helpful?

- Surrogate metric best practices

- Validate your predictive model and monitor over time

- General Modeling Best Practices:

- More resources on modeling best practices:

### 28. Statsig secures series C funding to bring science to the art of product development

**Date:** 2025-05-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
Product development used to be an art. A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. That simply doesn’t cut it today


**Key Points:**

- Product development used to be an art.

- With this investment, we’re doubling down on our mission to help every product team embrace the science of building great products.

- Building products today can get messy. Why?

- Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.

- Large teams create misalignment:Multiple stakeholders, disjointed workflows, and scattered data lead to endless debates instead of decisive action.

**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact. Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics


**Key Points:**

- Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact.

- When are Release Pipelines used?

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

### 32. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands
For a startup shipping one feature a month, an A/B test is a neat side project. At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude


**Key Points:**

- Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands

- Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude.

- Coverage: What fraction of product change is truly tested?

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

**Summary:**  
Infra teams now have an additional guardrail—alast line of defensewhen changing configs. At Statsig, we believe you can move fastwithoutbreaking things. That’s why we madefeature flagsa core tool in our platform—table stakes for modern software development


**Key Points:**

- Infra teams now have an additional guardrail—alast line of defensewhen changing configs.

- When feature flags aren't enough

- Suddenly, the other 99% of users—who haven't even seen the new feature—experience degraded performance or complete outages.

- This is where our release pipelines come in.

### 34. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them. At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Every new server-side feature meant copying and pasting evaluation logic into 10 repos, wrangling language quirks, and fighting version drift


**Key Points:**

- If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them.

- With this change, we're now seeingup to 5x evaluation speeds(!)—and that's just the cherry on top of all the code sustainability benefits.

- Figure 1:In our legacy model, every new server-side feature required duplicating evaluation logic code in all 10 server SDKs.

- Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:

- We used the following FFIs (Foreign Function Interfaces) for this Rust core project:

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
If you’d told me a decade ago that software teams would someday run more experiments than marketing, I’d have assumed you were joking—or pitching a dystopian adtech startup. Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. ThinkOptimizely's founding story—testing every piece of marketing in the Obama presidential campaign

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Author's Note: You will notice a lot of formulas in this article. Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. This survey summarizes these models as objectively as I could, but I'm going to publish other articles with my opinions


**Key Points:**

- Author's Note: You will notice a lot of formulas in this article.

- Brief history of marketing attribution in digital channels

- Major attribution models: rule-based vs. data-driven

- The first channel essentially gets the entire conversion value (often set to 1 or to the revenue amount).

### 38. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As an outsider to the SEO world, I'd always seen it as a world of convention: add your meta descriptions, set your canonicals, write something novel, and the traffic will come. It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Certainly, all of the above (metas, canonicals, novel content) are best practices—but if they're well-known principles, can they really se


**Key Points:**

- How can the algorithm—and its many rules—allow you to AB test like you normally would?

- First, and perhaps obviously, we have to follow the rules of the algorithm.

- For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:

- On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-ab-testing-is-ultimately-qualitative


**Summary:**  
A/B testing is essential for data-driven teams, but its real value isn’t just in the metrics—it’s in the ultimately qualitative decisions that those metrics enable. Understanding the bigger picture
Real-world decision-making doesn’t happen in a statistical vacuum. People with diverse perspectives have to debate options in a room, weighing pros and cons between multiple (sometimes conflicting) objectives, many of which can't be captured in a single metric


**Key Points:**

- Understanding the bigger picture

- The limitations of data and the role of expert judgment

- A balanced approach: Numbers and narrative

- Talk to the pros, become a proWe're on standby to help you start using your data to make better decisions.Let's chat

### 45. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As A/B testing analysts, we often encounter skewed distributions for our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), especially when dealing with revenue metrics. It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type II error (β):The probability of failing to detect a true improvement when one exists.

### 47. Designing controlled experiments to test correlated metrics

**Date:** 2025-03-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/designing-controlled-experiments-correlated-metrics


**Summary:**  
What are correlated metrics. Correlationoccurs when there is a relationship between the values of some variable with the values of some other bariable. This is contrasted byindependence, where there is no relationship between the values of two variables


**Key Points:**

- Correlated metrics in an experiment

- In an experimental context, you might care about several different types of correlated metrics:

- These all can serve different functions in an experiment

- Note that usage of Surrogate Metrics also requires for prediction error to be accounted for in reading experimental restuls.

- Independence assumptions in multiple comparison corrections

### 48. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another. When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Traditional per-user randomization often creates “cross-group contamination,” where one side of the marketplace in treatment interacts with another side in control


**Key Points:**

- A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another.

- Cluster-based randomization

- Switchback testing

- Phased Rollouts

- Weighted randomization (multi-armed bandits)

**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags aren't ruining your codebase. Lack of cleanup accountability is. Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others


**Key Points:**

- Feature flags aren't ruining your codebase. Lack of cleanup accountability is.

- If you’ve ever tried coding with feature flags, there’s a good chance this thought has crossed your mind at least once:

- TL;DR—Feature flags are not the problem, but theycanlead to messy code if you don’t use them responsibly. Here’s how to avoid that.

- Everyone’s happy. Job done, right?

- Say your product team runs a promo that changes how discounts are calculated. The current logic looks like this:

### 50. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. Bayesian alternatives promise more intuitive “probability of being better” metrics and flexible sequential monitoring


**Key Points:**

- Introduction

- This paper distinguishes two broad ways in which “informedness” can be brought into Bayesian A/B testing:

- Therefore, in applications, we should be careful about the misuse of Bayesian without understanding their misuse:

- Our goal is to clarify these trade-offs and suggest ways to harness Bayesian methods responsibly. For such purposes, we recommend two approaches:

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

### 52. Why data-driven marketing attribution models don&#39;t work as promised

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/data-driven-marketing-attribution-shortcomings


**Summary:**  
From huge enterprises to niche e-commerce brands, every marketer grapples with the same fundamental question: Where should we invest our marketing budget for the greatest return. Ideally, you’d like a tidy calculation that says, “Channel A accounts for 25% of conversions, Channel B for 40%, Channel C for 10%,” and so on. That’s the allure of marketing attribution: pinpointing exactly which touchpoints move the needle and which are mere distractions


**Key Points:**

- The problem: Evaluating marketing spend in a complex landscape

- What data-driven models promise

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

### 64. How Statsig uses query-level experiments to speed up Metrics Explorer

**Date:** 2025-02-20T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Nicole Smith  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/query-level-experiments-metrics-explorer


**Summary:**  
Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes. Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. This is a super common challenge for B2B companies: a professional user base means that behaviors are pretty static and there isn’t the same scale of users that Google or Facebook have to detect small effects


**Key Points:**

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- There are a few reasons why running an experiment can be helpful here in particular:

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

### 79. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment. However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Issues like website crashes when serving the control version could prevent the SDK from sending exposure events to Statsig.

- However, these tools have been limited to analyzing a preset list of dimensions, such assdk_type,browser,country, andos.

### 113. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products. In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms


**Key Points:**

- Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products.

- Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms.

- Based on this,I was initially fairly cynical about funnels. It’s true that funnels do have some fundamental limitations:

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-allies-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
For much of my career in data science, I had a sort of shared understanding with my colleagues that the worst part of the job is dealing with a constant deluge of questions. These questions range from the actually problematic (a stakeholder asking if you can do a drill down to find a “win” in their experiment results) to great questions that just require some mental bandwidth to answer well and randomize you from the work you were planning on doing. In my two years at Statsig, I’ve totally chang


**Key Points:**

- The stakeholders I’m usually working with at Statsig don’t work at Statsig.

- This, funnily enough, leads to a reinforcing loop; as we demonstrate a willingness to collaborate, people have more product asks. This is agoodthing.

- Introducing Product AnalyticsLearn how leading companies stay on top of every metric as they roll out features.Read more

- When I see a customer question more than once, this is a near-instant trigger for me to update documentation and reach out to the design team.

- This has been especially important as part of theStatsig Warehouse Nativeteam’s process since we’re tightly integrating with customers’ data layer!

### 212. Switchback experiments: Overview and considerations

**Date:** 2023-11-14T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/switchback-experiments


**Summary:**  
When should someone use a switchback test instead of an A/B test. Switchback experiments are a way to measure the impact of a change when network effects render traditional A/B tests impractical, as is often the case in 2-sided marketplace products. A canonical example of this scenario comes from ridesharing services likeLyft: All the riders in an area share the same supply of drivers, and vice versa


**Key Points:**

- When should someone use a switchback test instead of an A/B test?

- Since the test and control groups are not independent, a simple A/B test will produce inaccurate results.

- Questions about switchback testing?

- At the most basic level, the minimum requirement for setting up a switchback experiment is determining the time interval for switching.

- The standard t-test commonly used for traditional A/B tests is not recommended for switchback. experiments:

**Summary:**  
You don’t experiment for wins
In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:
This FOMO-engendering content has a point. Experimentation is a valuable tool for understanding what kind of changes work for your product; with that knowledge in hand, you can more reliably pick a good future direction. However, in practice—and especially in product experimentation—the real wins come from not losing


**Key Points:**

- In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:

- Chasing rainbows: The illusion of the big win

- The unpalatable truth is that these victories aren’t common, and are frequently incorrect. There are a number of contributing factors:

- A penny saved is a penny earned

- Product owners use the product differently than the typical user, which skews their intuition and causes them to design unhelpful features

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/leading-a-team-of-lions


**Summary:**  
Training your team to make independent decisions
“It was like the debate of a group of savages as to how to extract a screw from a piece of wood. Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear


**Key Points:**

- Training your team to make independent decisions

- People who are right a lot, they listen a lot, and people who are right a lot, change their mind a lot.

- People who are right seek to dis-confirm their most profoundly-held convictions, which is very unnatural for humans.

- Jeff Bezos

- I wish more folks shared how they train their teams and operationalize independent decision making. Here’s my short list.

### 254. Why do my Facebook Groups look different?

**Date:** 2022-06-14T20:58:00.000Z  
**Author:** Tore Hanssen  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-do-my-facebook-groups-look-different


**Summary:**  
By now, most people realize that when they open Facebook or Instagram on their phone, their experience is very different than the person next to them. It goes deeper than just the content that you see, and the ranking algorithms backings those — the buttons you have to click, the way a post with multiple photos shows up, or even theshade of the bluemight be different. At Statsig, we’ve been working to help any company run these same types of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Trying to experiment on a different unit type than a “user”? Or just miss GK::forID()?Try out customIDs on Statsig.

### 256. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool. The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Within Workplace, all you had to do was type #m followed by the name of your macro and the macro bot would respond to your comment or message with the macro associated with that name


**Key Points:**

- One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool.

- But why have a dedicated tool instead of sending the image yourself each time? A few main reasons:

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Create a Custom Integration within Workplace

### 258. Using Pulse Time Series for Deeper Insights

**Date:** 2022-05-16T19:35:15.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/using-pulse-time-series-for-deeper-insights


**Summary:**  
TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment. Sometimes, a brief scan of the color coded score card is enough to validate that all metrics behave as expected, and we quickly proceed with the launch. Other times, however, a more detailed understanding is required before deciding on next steps


**Key Points:**

- TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment.

- Does my experiment have a novelty effect? Do users try out the new feature once and never again?

- Is there pre-experiment bias in this metric? Was that lift there even before we launched the feature?

- This view shows the metric impact on each calendar day without aggregating days together. It’s a good one to check if we have concerns such as:

- Does the feature have a different impact on weekends vs. weekdays?

**Summary:**  
A Bayesian exploration of road rage methodology, and its important applications to experimentation
Disclaimer: this is in good fun and I don’t advocate road rage. You, dear reader, are driving somewhere nice. However, the driver behind you is determined to make you have a bad day; they’ve come up uncomfortably close behind you and you’re pretty sure they’re a bad driver who should feel bad about how they’re driving


**Key Points:**

- A Bayesian exploration of road rage methodology, and its important applications to experimentation

- Disclaimer: this is in good fun and I don’t advocate road rage.

- Soon, they pass you, and the age-old question rings through your brain:

- Do I need to let this person know that they’re a jerk?

- The decision above is of course a personal one, but it does have some interesting inputs.

### 260. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
An opinionated guide on using Holdouts
Feature Level Holdouts
Good teams move fast. They’re trying several ideas at any given time. When they find something that works, they ship it and find the next idea to try


**Key Points:**

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Engineering overhead. For each feature you ship with a holdout, you’re committing to support an if-then-else fork in your code. For a fast moving team, having to support multiple code paths makes the test and debug matrix large. Shorter holdouts help make this manageable. When your legacy code path breaks — if you don’t find and fix it swiftly, your holdout results become untrustworthy.

- Opportunity cost. When you ship features that increase revenue or retention, a large holdout means leaving those gains on the table. There’s also dissatisfaction you cause when someone sees a friend with a shiny new feature that they don’t have.

- Monitoring. Holdouts are typically analyzed in detail only at the end of the holdout period. It’s useful to check in on them at a regular cadence (e.g. monthly) to make sure there isn’t anything unexpected that may taint the holdout. A broken control variant impacting only 1% of your users can make the Holdout useless if you only detect it at the end of the holdout period. There’s little point comparing metrics between users with new features and users with a broken experience. The act of checking the performance of the Holdout group can spawn investigations to understand unexpected movements.

- Users, Customer Support & Marketing.For people in the holdout, it is confusing to see friends get a spiffy new feature, while you don’t. It’s important to retire and create new holdouts every cycle — so it’s not the same set of users punished again and again.

### 261. There’s More To Learn From Tests

**Date:** 2022-04-20T18:45:44.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts. ) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way


**Key Points:**

- The Standard: Pre-Launch Experimentation

- It’s common that when people think about testing, they mostly think about pre-launch experimentation:

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

**Summary:**  
The tools that make our jobs possible
When my co-workerSami Springmanand I joined Statsig, we both came from Snowflake- a mature sales organization with every bizdev tool you could dream of. As the first sales people at Statsig, we’ve been building our biztech stack from zero. After some trial and error, we have a list of 4 tools wecan’t live without


**Key Points:**

- The tools that make our jobs possible

- To be totally candid, without Sales Navigator, my job would benext-to-impossible.

- Most of the outbound business we source is either directly through LinkedIn, or from Zoominfo phone numbers/ emails.

- The only caveat for Outreach- the tool is less useful for account execs who aren’t making many cold calls + bulk emails.

- For younger orgs without published contact info, Seamless has been very helpful.

**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/reading-experimentation-tea-leaves


**Summary:**  
Making experiment readouts trustworthy
As we talk to many customers, one thing is clear: many common beliefs for product experimentation are plain wrong. These are often theoretical, academic and outdated. They lead teams to believe in a false sense of precision and waste months waiting on a handful of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Making experiment readouts trustworthy

- With great power though comes great responsibility

- You can also useholdouts and backteststo measure the cumulative impact of features over a longer period of time.

- A few tips to make sure you’re not reacting to noise -

- Have a hypothesis on the change you’re making (and expected impact). If you’re rolling out a bug fix to the video player in the Facebook app and see a small reduction in new user signups, it’s unlikely your bug fix is causing that. But if you are seeing an increase in video watch time, then you can usually be sure your fix is working as intended. Many practitioners apply a 95% confidence interval to metrics they’re expecting impact on, and use a 99% confidence interval on other metrics.

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/failing-fast-kiss-a-lot-of-frogs


**Summary:**  
Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast. In a startup, everybody builds stuff (code, websites, sales lists, etc) — and part of the building process is accepting that not everything you make is good. But, switching from outcome to learning-oriented can speed up productivity, and make it easier to identify good ideas


**Key Points:**

- Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast.

- But, this is when I learned the value of minimum viable products (MVPs).

I worked on Facebook News Feed before I joined Statsig, and that’s where I learned about the value of experimentation. The culture in News Feed wasn’t just to use experiments to verify that our intuitions about what changes may lead to improvements were true. We also used experiments much like any good scientist would to understand more about their field—we started with a question, formed a hypothesis, and then went about constructing an experiment that would allow us to test our hypothesis and

**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence. An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in.

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
Sales is all about process. I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel


**Key Points:**

- Nail your pitch

- I pitch to my mom. If she doesn’t understand it, I still have work to do.

- For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”

- Don’t reinvent the wheel

- Spend the 10 minutes to build out a great email, save it, andmake sure you never write that email again.

### 289. User-Level vs. Device-Level Experiments with Statsig

**Date:** 2021-10-15T03:47:36.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/user-level-vs-device-level-experiments


**Summary:**  
A common challenge in A/B testing arises when we want to track customers from logged-out to logged-in states. Consider, for example, testing a new variant of the account creation flow. This begins with logged-out customers, but we also want to monitor key metrics and events once they complete the flow and log in


**Key Points:**

- Comparing key metrics across test and control groups requires joining 2 different sets of logs: Exposures and events.

- Exposures:Every time we run a check to determine which experience is delivered to a user (e.g.: test or control), we create a log containing:

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Group: The experiment group they were placed in

### 315. My Five Favorite Things About Swift

**Date:** 2021-05-11T07:20:26.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/my-five-favorite-things-about-swift


**Summary:**  
Statsigstrives to empower all developers to ship features faster, so naturally one of the first milestones for us was to provide an SDK for iOS development. I started doing iOS development at Facebook, which only used Objective-C for its iOS apps. But given Swift’s growing popularity (Apple’s own adoption has been growing quickly), we decided to offer and write our SDK natively in Swift


**Key Points:**

- Swift is much more readable

- NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;

- NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;

- NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];

- Swift supports modern language features

**Author:** Rodrigo Roim  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ruid-time-travel-safe-distributed-unique-64-bit-ids-generated-in-rust


**Summary:**  
RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust
RUIDs (Rodrigo’s Unique Identifiers) are 64 bit ids mathematically guaranteed to be unique when generated within the sameRUID root. Check it out on GitHub. AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration


**Key Points:**

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

- The canonical version of RUIDs (this repo) uses 41 bits for timestamp, 14 bits for a monotonically increasing sequence, and 9 bits for the root id.

- bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/pitfalls-of-multi-arm-experiments


**Summary:**  
Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups
As companies become more comfortable with running AB tests, they often consider simultaneously testing more than one variation. It’s called a multi-arm experiment, also known as multi-group and A/B/n (ABn) testing (but should not be confused withmulti-armed bandit experiments, hopefully the topic of a later blog post). Multi-arm testing involves two or more test groups (eg


**Key Points:**

- Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups

- Significance is Much More Significant

- Solution #1: Apply a Bonferroni correction

- The Bonferroni correction is risk-adverse solution that errs on avoiding Type I errors at the expense of Type II errors.

- Solution #2: Repeat your experiment

**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-we-started-statsig


**Summary:**  
When I joined Facebook, one of the things that surprised me was the autonomy Engineers had in building new products and features, and how this enabled them to move really fast. I was curious how decisions were made around product features, since based on my previous experience, the bulk of the time sink happened inside conference rooms — where experienced engineers and PMs debated the details, made decisions, and wrote design docs, all before the first line of code was even written. Product deve


**Key Points:**

- Product development at Facebook often started with the germ of an idea which was quickly translated into code.

- If people wrote code right away, how did they make sure they were building features users actually wanted?

- Gatekeeper:Allows developers to build features visible only to a targeted set of users. For example, these could bedogfoodersand testers until a feature is ready for public consumption. Engineers will then open it up to a small user base to validate everything is working well before launching to the world.

- And the biggest peace-of-mind comes from knowing that when something goes really wrong at any point,you can easily turn features off in real-time.

- Quick Experiments (A/B):This tool takes the debates out of conference rooms and puts hypotheses to test in production. Instead of endless discussions about the “perfect” design, the amount of flexibility to provide, the corner cases to cover, engineers quickly code up different variants and put them out in front of users. How users interact with the product gives rich insights into what works and what doesn’t.

### 5. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
AI is changing how we build software. With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. As teams embed AI deeper into their products, and they're facing a new challenge


**Key Points:**

- AI is changing how we build software.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

- AI breaks this model in two critical ways:

- Today, AI products operate in open-ended domains where "correct" has infinite variations and context matters more than accuracy.

- Teams are operating without the foundation they used to rely on: the ability to rigorously test software in a non-production environment.

### 6. The more the merrier? The problem of multiple comparisons in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-07-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
The problem of multiple comparisons represents a fundamental clash between statistical inference and human intuition. After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results. The goal of this blog is to explain why our intuition leads us astray in this case and to clarify the multiple comparisons problem


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- Figure 1.Probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (alpha) as a function of the number of tests.

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

- Now that we understand why multiple comparisons are problematic, let’s look at some common scenarios in A/B testing where this issue often arises:

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools. Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift. With your current traffic, that meanseleven weeksof waiting to gather enough user data


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

### 8. You can have it all: Parallel testing with A/B tests

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights. However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. This approach creates a bottleneck, delaying the launch of new experiments until the ongoing one is completed


**Key Points:**

- In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights.

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- The illustration below outlines two possible scenarios for this kind of test:

**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- It’s not an exaggeration to say thatevery leading AI application relies on systematic A/B testingto test, launch, and optimize their product.

- Now, as AI takes on more of the “build” in the build > measure > learn loop,measurement, optimization, and iteration become even more critical.

- We've noticed some particularly interesting trends in how traditional experimentation is evolving to support AI development.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

### 11. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now. When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%

**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them. After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. The challenge of proving value
When I joined Statsig as PM for our SDKs team, I faced a daunting reality: much of my engineering team had been th


**Key Points:**

- The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them.

- This fear isn't unique to me. I've seen it repeatedly in conversations with other PMs, including many of our customers.

- The natural response to this anxiety is to try to prove your worth through control.

- The two paths for product leaders

- When facing this credibility gap, product managers typically choose between two paths:

**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture. When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. My metrics-focused foundation
My tech career began as a Growth Manager at Rupeek, a Series-A fintech startup in India


**Key Points:**

- The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture.

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- This revealed the true PM dilemma: It's easy to say 'focus on outcomes', but much harder to identify which outcomes matter.

- This created three key problems:

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 15. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
The distinction between “do no harm” and “do good” goals significantly impacts the type of test you choose and the likelihood of obtaining a meaningful result. Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- Here are some situations where non-inferiority testing can be particularly relevant:

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- After setting the margin (Δ) it is time to formulate the hypotheses for a right-tail test:

**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management. After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. The pressure to get it perfect
As a data scientist at Uber, I enjoyed the process of building a deep understanding of the products I worked on: analyzing data, presenting insights and making r


**Key Points:**

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

- While I was confident in my product strategy, the root of the issue washow I approached execution.

- By polishing a "perfect" plan before involving senior stakeholders, I created two critical problems:

- What I should have done was ship thin slices early:releaseminimal viable productsthat tested core hypotheses andgenerated real user feedback.

- By getting something tangible in front of users and stakeholders quickly, PMs can:

### 17. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
You don’t need to wait a year to know if your feature worked—surrogate metrics let you move fastandstay anchored to long-term outcomes that actually matter. Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. If you bring the predicted values and mean squared error (MSE) of the model used to make these predictions, we’ll accurately account for the model’s prediction error when calculating p-values and confidence intervals


**Key Points:**

- Why are surrogate metrics helpful?

- Surrogate metric best practices

- Validate your predictive model and monitor over time

- General Modeling Best Practices:

- More resources on modeling best practices:

**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
Product development used to be an art. A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. That simply doesn’t cut it today


**Key Points:**

- Product development used to be an art.

- With this investment, we’re doubling down on our mission to help every product team embrace the science of building great products.

- Building products today can get messy. Why?

- Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.

- Large teams create misalignment:Multiple stakeholders, disjointed workflows, and scattered data lead to endless debates instead of decisive action.

**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact. Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics


**Key Points:**

- Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact.

- When are Release Pipelines used?

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

### 20. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them. At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Every new server-side feature meant copying and pasting evaluation logic into 10 repos, wrangling language quirks, and fighting version drift


**Key Points:**

- If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them.

- With this change, we're now seeingup to 5x evaluation speeds(!)—and that's just the cherry on top of all the code sustainability benefits.

- Figure 1:In our legacy model, every new server-side feature required duplicating evaluation logic code in all 10 server SDKs.

- Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:

- We used the following FFIs (Foreign Function Interfaces) for this Rust core project:

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
If you’d told me a decade ago that software teams would someday run more experiments than marketing, I’d have assumed you were joking—or pitching a dystopian adtech startup. Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. ThinkOptimizely's founding story—testing every piece of marketing in the Obama presidential campaign


**Key Points:**

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Author's Note: You will notice a lot of formulas in this article. Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. This survey summarizes these models as objectively as I could, but I'm going to publish other articles with my opinions


**Key Points:**

- Author's Note: You will notice a lot of formulas in this article.

- Brief history of marketing attribution in digital channels

- Major attribution models: rule-based vs. data-driven

- The first channel essentially gets the entire conversion value (often set to 1 or to the revenue amount).

### 23. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As an outsider to the SEO world, I'd always seen it as a world of convention: add your meta descriptions, set your canonicals, write something novel, and the traffic will come. It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Certainly, all of the above (metas, canonicals, novel content) are best practices—but if they're well-known principles, can they really se


**Key Points:**

- How can the algorithm—and its many rules—allow you to AB test like you normally would?

- First, and perhaps obviously, we have to follow the rules of the algorithm.

- For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:

- On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

### 26. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As A/B testing analysts, we often encounter skewed distributions for our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), especially when dealing with revenue metrics. It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type II error (β):The probability of failing to detect a true improvement when one exists.

### 27. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another. When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Traditional per-user randomization often creates “cross-group contamination,” where one side of the marketplace in treatment interacts with another side in control


**Key Points:**

- A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another.

- Cluster-based randomization

- Switchback testing

- Phased Rollouts

- Weighted randomization (multi-armed bandits)

**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags aren't ruining your codebase. Lack of cleanup accountability is. Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others


**Key Points:**

- Feature flags aren't ruining your codebase. Lack of cleanup accountability is.

- If you’ve ever tried coding with feature flags, there’s a good chance this thought has crossed your mind at least once:

- TL;DR—Feature flags are not the problem, but theycanlead to messy code if you don’t use them responsibly. Here’s how to avoid that.

- Everyone’s happy. Job done, right?

- Say your product team runs a promo that changes how discounts are calculated. The current logic looks like this:

### 29. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. Bayesian alternatives promise more intuitive “probability of being better” metrics and flexible sequential monitoring


**Key Points:**

- Introduction

- This paper distinguishes two broad ways in which “informedness” can be brought into Bayesian A/B testing:

- Therefore, in applications, we should be careful about the misuse of Bayesian without understanding their misuse:

- Our goal is to clarify these trade-offs and suggest ways to harness Bayesian methods responsibly. For such purposes, we recommend two approaches:

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

### 41. How Statsig uses query-level experiments to speed up Metrics Explorer

**Date:** 2025-02-20T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Nicole Smith  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/query-level-experiments-metrics-explorer


**Summary:**  
Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes. Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. This is a super common challenge for B2B companies: a professional user base means that behaviors are pretty static and there isn’t the same scale of users that Google or Facebook have to detect small effects


**Key Points:**

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- There are a few reasons why running an experiment can be helpful here in particular:

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products. In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms


**Key Points:**

- Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products.

- Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms.

- Based on this,I was initially fairly cynical about funnels. It’s true that funnels do have some fundamental limitations:

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

### 111. When to use Bayesian experiments: A beginner’s guide

**Date:** 2024-04-16T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-experiments-beginners-guide


**Summary:**  
Where frequentist statistics assigns probabilities to data, Bayesian assigns probabilities to hypotheses. Traditionally, A/B testing has been dominated by Frequentist statistics, which rely on p-values and confidence intervals to make decisions. However, there's another approach that's gaining traction for its intuitive nature and ease of interpretation:Bayesian experiments


**Key Points:**

- Where frequentist statistics assigns probabilities to data, Bayesian assigns probabilities to hypotheses.

- Bayesian A/B testing leverages a different statistical framework, one that incorporates prior knowledge and updates beliefs with new data.

- Why experimenters sometimes opt for Bayesian experiments

- Complex models: If you're dealing with complex models or multiple metrics, Bayesian methods can help manage the intricacies more effectively.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-allies-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
For much of my career in data science, I had a sort of shared understanding with my colleagues that the worst part of the job is dealing with a constant deluge of questions. These questions range from the actually problematic (a stakeholder asking if you can do a drill down to find a “win” in their experiment results) to great questions that just require some mental bandwidth to answer well and randomize you from the work you were planning on doing. In my two years at Statsig, I’ve totally chang


**Key Points:**

- The stakeholders I’m usually working with at Statsig don’t work at Statsig.

- This, funnily enough, leads to a reinforcing loop; as we demonstrate a willingness to collaborate, people have more product asks. This is agoodthing.

- Introducing Product AnalyticsLearn how leading companies stay on top of every metric as they roll out features.Read more

- When I see a customer question more than once, this is a near-instant trigger for me to update documentation and reach out to the design team.

### 136. Sequential Testing on Statsig

**Date:** 2023-10-18T00:00-04:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/sequential-testing-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Sequential testing is a solution to the “peeking problem” in A/B testing, allowing continuous monitoring of experiment results without increasing the False Positive Rate (FPR). We recently revamped Statsig’s Sequential Testing methodology to enable faster decisions. Compared to our previous implementation, this new approach has higher statistical power during the early days of the experiment while enforcing a strict cap on FPR


**Key Points:**

- The need for sequential testing

- Limitations of the underlying statistical test

- Statsig’s sequential testing methodology

- The false positive rate in A/A tests remains below 5% even with repeated measurements over a 4-week period.

- The false positive rate in A/A tests remains below 5% even with repeated measurements over a 4-week period.

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statbot-ai-manual-tasks-hackathon


**Summary:**  
I’m not really a “manual labor” guy…
Not to say I won’t rake some leaves, build a desk, orsplice buttons onto my PS5 controller. I’m talking aboutcopying and pasting, rephrasing, categorizing, and other tedious, manual tasks. There’s a tired old trope about howAI is not good enough to "replace people


**Key Points:**

- I’m not really a “manual labor” guy…

- AI assists me with the manual labor I so dread—the tasks that make me feel less like a marketer and more likean LLMmyself.

- Statsig is full of help. Ourwebsite documentationis comprehensive and includeswalkthroughs and guideson tons of relevant topics:

- But in terms of prioritization,writing a glossary would take weeks, and there are much better things to spend that time on…

- Foundation model:Determines which GPT model is used to generate responses. GPT-4 is great for readability.

**Date:** 2023-10-02T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/semantic-layer-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Semantic layers act as a bridge between raw data and business users, translating complex data structures into understandable and usable commodities. As with most best practices, the power of a semantic layer is amplified when used in conjunction with Statsig. This post aims toshed light on the relationship between a semantic layer and experimentation, exploring the intricacies of supporting semantic layers, and how to re-use metrics that are already aggregated/computed in your warehouse and desc


**Key Points:**

- Semantic layers act as a bridge between raw data and business users, translating complex data structures into understandable and usable commodities.

- As with most best practices, the power of a semantic layer is amplified when used in conjunction with Statsig.

- A promising solution to this issue is the introduction of a semantic layer.

- The semantic layer serves as a centralized translator, bridging the gap between the data storage and the data consumers.

- Typically, a semantic layer is a repository of static YAML/SQL files that represent a semantic graph that can be used to query metrics.

### 139. A quick guide to sample ratio mismatch (SRM)

**Date:** 2023-08-31T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
"Let’s use a coin toss to decide—first to 50 wins. "
Imagine we’re flipping a fair coin several times and get 8 heads and 2 tails. (A fair coin is a balanced one, and has never been used in a magician’s routine


**Key Points:**

- Sample ratio mismatch is evidence of selection bias

- Points to an implementation issue

- This won’t happen if you’re using Statsig because our SDK filters out ineligible users evenly across all experiment groups

- Data processing issues:there may be some process by which this data is being deleted or duplicated for only the control or test variant.

- If you’re sending all your data through Statsig, we do the data processing and there shouldn’t be SRM coming from data processing

**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-vs-buy-feature-flags-gates-experiment-platform


**Summary:**  
In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig. I’ve observed some patterns and developed some standard questions that I ask these customers, which I think objectively helps them begin to understand which of the build and/or buy options is right for them. Longer term I plan to create a calculator or survey that can help people understand which option they should prioritize, but in the meantime I want to share


**Key Points:**

- In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig.

- Building an experimentation platform requires specialized engineering, data science and data engineering skills and resources.

- Have your team members built similar systems before?

- What kind of infrastructure and architecture is your team familiar with?

- After surveying your team, if the answer to this question doesn’t inspire confidence,you should consider buying, or a hybrid build and buy.

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/leading-a-team-of-lions


**Summary:**  
Training your team to make independent decisions
“It was like the debate of a group of savages as to how to extract a screw from a piece of wood. Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear


**Key Points:**

- Training your team to make independent decisions

- People who are right a lot, they listen a lot, and people who are right a lot, change their mind a lot.

- People who are right seek to dis-confirm their most profoundly-held convictions, which is very unnatural for humans.

- Jeff Bezos

- I wish more folks shared how they train their teams and operationalize independent decision making. Here’s my short list.

### 159. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool. The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Within Workplace, all you had to do was type #m followed by the name of your macro and the macro bot would respond to your comment or message with the macro associated with that name


**Key Points:**

- One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool.

- But why have a dedicated tool instead of sending the image yourself each time? A few main reasons:

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Create a Custom Integration within Workplace

### 160. Using Pulse Time Series for Deeper Insights

**Date:** 2022-05-16T19:35:15.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/using-pulse-time-series-for-deeper-insights


**Summary:**  
TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment. Sometimes, a brief scan of the color coded score card is enough to validate that all metrics behave as expected, and we quickly proceed with the launch. Other times, however, a more detailed understanding is required before deciding on next steps


**Key Points:**

- TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment.

- Does my experiment have a novelty effect? Do users try out the new feature once and never again?

- Is there pre-experiment bias in this metric? Was that lift there even before we launched the feature?

- This view shows the metric impact on each calendar day without aggregating days together. It’s a good one to check if we have concerns such as:

- Does the feature have a different impact on weekends vs. weekdays?

A Bayesian exploration of road rage methodology, and its important applications to experimentation
Disclaimer: this is in good fun and I don’t advocate road rage. You, dear reader, are driving somewhere nice. However, the driver behind you is determined to make you have a bad day; they’ve come up uncomfortably close behind you and you’re pretty sure they’re a bad driver who should feel bad about how they’re driving


**Key Points:**

- A Bayesian exploration of road rage methodology, and its important applications to experimentation

- Disclaimer: this is in good fun and I don’t advocate road rage.

- Soon, they pass you, and the age-old question rings through your brain:

- Do I need to let this person know that they’re a jerk?

- The decision above is of course a personal one, but it does have some interesting inputs.

### 162. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
An opinionated guide on using Holdouts
Feature Level Holdouts
Good teams move fast. They’re trying several ideas at any given time. When they find something that works, they ship it and find the next idea to try


**Key Points:**

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Engineering overhead. For each feature you ship with a holdout, you’re committing to support an if-then-else fork in your code. For a fast moving team, having to support multiple code paths makes the test and debug matrix large. Shorter holdouts help make this manageable. When your legacy code path breaks — if you don’t find and fix it swiftly, your holdout results become untrustworthy.

- Opportunity cost. When you ship features that increase revenue or retention, a large holdout means leaving those gains on the table. There’s also dissatisfaction you cause when someone sees a friend with a shiny new feature that they don’t have.

- Monitoring. Holdouts are typically analyzed in detail only at the end of the holdout period. It’s useful to check in on them at a regular cadence (e.g. monthly) to make sure there isn’t anything unexpected that may taint the holdout. A broken control variant impacting only 1% of your users can make the Holdout useless if you only detect it at the end of the holdout period. There’s little point comparing metrics between users with new features and users with a broken experience. The act of checking the performance of the Holdout group can spawn investigations to understand unexpected movements.

- Users, Customer Support & Marketing.For people in the holdout, it is confusing to see friends get a spiffy new feature, while you don’t. It’s important to retire and create new holdouts every cycle — so it’s not the same set of users punished again and again.

### 165. Democratizing Experimentation

**Date:** 2022-03-21T05:41:41.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/democratizing-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Experiment Review Best Practices
A surprise win. When building out instant games on Facebook a few years back, a new developer switched to use a newer version of an internal SDK. The switch was motivated by keeping the code base supportable and it was expected to have no impact on users


**Key Points:**

- Experiment Review Best Practices

- Unknowingly shipping bad experiments can be terrible. They’ll stick around and may negate the wins from ten good experiments!

- Experiment kick off

- Evaluating the hypothesis

- Critique/Reviews

### 166. Reading Experimentation Tea Leaves

**Date:** 2022-03-09T02:11:15.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/reading-experimentation-tea-leaves


**Summary:**  
Making experiment readouts trustworthy
As we talk to many customers, one thing is clear: many common beliefs for product experimentation are plain wrong. These are often theoretical, academic and outdated. They lead teams to believe in a false sense of precision and waste months waiting on a handful of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Making experiment readouts trustworthy

- With great power though comes great responsibility

- You can also useholdouts and backteststo measure the cumulative impact of features over a longer period of time.

- A few tips to make sure you’re not reacting to noise -

- Have a hypothesis on the change you’re making (and expected impact). If you’re rolling out a bug fix to the video player in the Facebook app and see a small reduction in new user signups, it’s unlikely your bug fix is causing that. But if you are seeing an increase in video watch time, then you can usually be sure your fix is working as intended. Many practitioners apply a 95% confidence interval to metrics they’re expecting impact on, and use a 99% confidence interval on other metrics.

### 167. Failing fast, or How I learned to kiss a lot of frogs

**Date:** 2022-02-09T01:43:22.000Z  
**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/failing-fast-kiss-a-lot-of-frogs


**Summary:**  
Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast. In a startup, everybody builds stuff (code, websites, sales lists, etc) — and part of the building process is accepting that not everything you make is good. But, switching from outcome to learning-oriented can speed up productivity, and make it easier to identify good ideas


**Key Points:**

- Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast.

- But, this is when I learned the value of minimum viable products (MVPs).

**Summary:**  
I worked on Facebook News Feed before I joined Statsig, and that’s where I learned about the value of experimentation. The culture in News Feed wasn’t just to use experiments to verify that our intuitions about what changes may lead to improvements were true. We also used experiments much like any good scientist would to understand more about their field—we started with a question, formed a hypothesis, and then went about constructing an experiment that would allow us to test our hypothesis and 


**Key Points:**

- I worked on Facebook News Feed before I joined Statsig, and that’s where I learned about the value of experimentation.

**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/environments-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
In the summer of 2021, HBO accidentally sent an email to millions of past and current subscribers with the body “This message is used by integration tests only”. The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments. For continuous deployment, teams often create environments for development, staging and production


**Key Points:**

- The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments.

- Two philosophies : Per Environment Config vs Global Config

- Some advantages of the Global Config approach (with environment specific exceptions) include…

- This is useful in production where stability is paramount, but can slow down iteration in development and staging environments.

### 173. Sales development hacks

**Date:** 2021-10-20T02:14:39.000Z  
**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
Sales is all about process. I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel


**Key Points:**

- Nail your pitch

- I pitch to my mom. If she doesn’t understand it, I still have work to do.

- For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”

- Don’t reinvent the wheel

- Spend the 10 minutes to build out a great email, save it, andmake sure you never write that email again.

### 174. User-Level vs. Device-Level Experiments with Statsig

**Date:** 2021-10-15T03:47:36.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/user-level-vs-device-level-experiments


**Summary:**  
A common challenge in A/B testing arises when we want to track customers from logged-out to logged-in states. Consider, for example, testing a new variant of the account creation flow. This begins with logged-out customers, but we also want to monitor key metrics and events once they complete the flow and log in


**Key Points:**

- Comparing key metrics across test and control groups requires joining 2 different sets of logs: Exposures and events.

- Exposures:Every time we run a check to determine which experience is delivered to a user (e.g.: test or control), we create a log containing:

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Group: The experiment group they were placed in

### 8. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
AI is changing how we build software. With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. As teams embed AI deeper into their products, and they're facing a new challenge


**Key Points:**

- AI is changing how we build software.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

- AI breaks this model in two critical ways:

- Today, AI products operate in open-ended domains where "correct" has infinite variations and context matters more than accuracy.

- Teams are operating without the foundation they used to rely on: the ability to rigorously test software in a non-production environment.

At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built. We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. It’s not an exaggeration to say thatevery leading AI application relies on systematic A/B testingto test, launch, and optimize their prod


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- It’s not an exaggeration to say thatevery leading AI application relies on systematic A/B testingto test, launch, and optimize their product.

- Now, as AI takes on more of the “build” in the build > measure > learn loop,measurement, optimization, and iteration become even more critical.

- We've noticed some particularly interesting trends in how traditional experimentation is evolving to support AI development.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

**Summary:**  
When we first started Statsig, we had one infra engineer and a highly manual process. Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. You know that meme: “If your infra dev got hit by a bus, would your company survive


**Key Points:**

- The answer was yes, but it took a lot of clever design decisions and tooling.

- You can think of this process in three main phases. We’ll walk through each in detail, but in a nutshell:

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

### 12. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now. When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%


**Key Points:**

- Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now.

- Introducing Fieller intervals in Statsig

- What's the difference between Fieller intervals and the Delta Method?

- How are Fieller intervals calculated?

- Determine if a Fieller interval is well-defined

**Summary:**  
The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them. After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. The challenge of proving value
When I joined Statsig as PM for our SDKs team, I faced a daunting reality: much of my engineering team had been th


**Key Points:**

**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture. When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. My metrics-focused foundation
My tech career began as a Growth Manager at Rupeek, a Series-A fintech startup in India


**Key Points:**

- The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture.

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- This revealed the true PM dilemma: It's easy to say 'focus on outcomes', but much harder to identify which outcomes matter.

- This created three key problems:

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
The distinction between “do no harm” and “do good” goals significantly impacts the type of test you choose and the likelihood of obtaining a meaningful result. Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- Here are some situations where non-inferiority testing can be particularly relevant:

As a data scientist at Uber, I enjoyed the process of building a deep understanding of the products I worked on: analyzing data, presenting insights and making r


**Key Points:**

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

- While I was confident in my product strategy, the root of the issue washow I approached execution.

- By polishing a "perfect" plan before involving senior stakeholders, I created two critical problems:

- What I should have done was ship thin slices early:releaseminimal viable productsthat tested core hypotheses andgenerated real user feedback.

- By getting something tangible in front of users and stakeholders quickly, PMs can:

**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
You don’t need to wait a year to know if your feature worked—surrogate metrics let you move fastandstay anchored to long-term outcomes that actually matter. Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. If you bring the predicted values and mean squared error (MSE) of the model used to make these predictions, we’ll accurately account for the model’s prediction error when calculating p-values and confidence intervals


**Key Points:**

- Why are surrogate metrics helpful?

- Surrogate metric best practices

- Validate your predictive model and monitor over time

- General Modeling Best Practices:

**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
Product development used to be an art. A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. That simply doesn’t cut it today


**Key Points:**

- Product development used to be an art.

- With this investment, we’re doubling down on our mission to help every product team embrace the science of building great products.

- Building products today can get messy. Why?

- Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.

- Large teams create misalignment:Multiple stakeholders, disjointed workflows, and scattered data lead to endless debates instead of decisive action.

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands
For a startup shipping one feature a month, an A/B test is a neat side project. At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude


**Key Points:**

- Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands

- Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude.

- Coverage: What fraction of product change is truly tested?

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them. At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Every new server-side feature meant copying and pasting evaluation logic into 10 repos, wrangling language quirks, and fighting version drift


**Key Points:**

- If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them.

- With this change, we're now seeingup to 5x evaluation speeds(!)—and that's just the cherry on top of all the code sustainability benefits.

- Figure 1:In our legacy model, every new server-side feature required duplicating evaluation logic code in all 10 server SDKs.

- Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:

- We used the following FFIs (Foreign Function Interfaces) for this Rust core project:

**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As an outsider to the SEO world, I'd always seen it as a world of convention: add your meta descriptions, set your canonicals, write something novel, and the traffic will come. It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Certainly, all of the above (metas, canonicals, novel content) are best practices—but if they're well-known principles, can they really se


**Key Points:**

- How can the algorithm—and its many rules—allow you to AB test like you normally would?

- First, and perhaps obviously, we have to follow the rules of the algorithm.

- For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:

- On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

### 46. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment. However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Issues like website crashes when serving the control version could prevent the SDK from sending exposure events to Statsig.

- However, these tools have been limited to analyzing a preset list of dimensions, such assdk_type,browser,country, andos.

- Step 1:In your project settings, list the custom dimensions you want to analyze.

- Step 2:Navigate to the Diagnostics tab and open the Experiment Health Checks.

**Date:** 2024-09-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sam Miller  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/optimizing-config-propagation-time-with-target-apps


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we’re constantly finding ways to drive down what we call config propagation latency. Propagation latency is defined as the time it takes for a change made in the Console to be reflected by the config checks you issue on your frontend or backend systems with our SDKs. Recently, we made a significant improvement to how we generate the config definitions consumed by Server SDKs when using Target Apps


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we’re constantly finding ways to drive down what we call config propagation latency.

- Target apps are an advanced feature that helps manage which configurations are delivered to specific SDK instances or services.

- The benefits of using target apps are very straightforward:

- The optimization is centered around a new in-memory cache that pre-filters configurations based on the target app. Here's how it works:

- As your integration with Statsig scales, consider adopting target apps to improve performance.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-allies-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
For much of my career in data science, I had a sort of shared understanding with my colleagues that the worst part of the job is dealing with a constant deluge of questions. These questions range from the actually problematic (a stakeholder asking if you can do a drill down to find a “win” in their experiment results) to great questions that just require some mental bandwidth to answer well and randomize you from the work you were planning on doing. In my two years at Statsig, I’ve totally chang


**Key Points:**

- The stakeholders I’m usually working with at Statsig don’t work at Statsig.

- This, funnily enough, leads to a reinforcing loop; as we demonstrate a willingness to collaborate, people have more product asks. This is agoodthing.

- Introducing Product AnalyticsLearn how leading companies stay on top of every metric as they roll out features.Read more

- When I see a customer question more than once, this is a near-instant trigger for me to update documentation and reach out to the design team.

### 134. Sequential Testing on Statsig

**Date:** 2023-10-18T00:00-04:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/sequential-testing-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Sequential testing is a solution to the “peeking problem” in A/B testing, allowing continuous monitoring of experiment results without increasing the False Positive Rate (FPR). We recently revamped Statsig’s Sequential Testing methodology to enable faster decisions. Compared to our previous implementation, this new approach has higher statistical power during the early days of the experiment while enforcing a strict cap on FPR


**Key Points:**

- The need for sequential testing

- Limitations of the underlying statistical test

- Statsig’s sequential testing methodology

- The false positive rate in A/A tests remains below 5% even with repeated measurements over a 4-week period.

- The false positive rate in A/A tests remains below 5% even with repeated measurements over a 4-week period.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statbot-ai-manual-tasks-hackathon


**Summary:**  
I’m not really a “manual labor” guy…
Not to say I won’t rake some leaves, build a desk, orsplice buttons onto my PS5 controller. I’m talking aboutcopying and pasting, rephrasing, categorizing, and other tedious, manual tasks. There’s a tired old trope about howAI is not good enough to "replace people


**Key Points:**

- I’m not really a “manual labor” guy…

- AI assists me with the manual labor I so dread—the tasks that make me feel less like a marketer and more likean LLMmyself.

- Statsig is full of help. Ourwebsite documentationis comprehensive and includeswalkthroughs and guideson tons of relevant topics:

- But in terms of prioritization,writing a glossary would take weeks, and there are much better things to spend that time on…

- Foundation model:Determines which GPT model is used to generate responses. GPT-4 is great for readability.

### 139. Cumulative impact versus big wins: Chasing the experimentation rainbow

**Date:** 2023-06-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cumulative-impact-experimentation-wins


**Summary:**  
You don’t experiment for wins
In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:
This FOMO-engendering content has a point. Experimentation is a valuable tool for understanding what kind of changes work for your product; with that knowledge in hand, you can more reliably pick a good future direction. However, in practice—and especially in product experimentation—the real wins come from not losing


**Key Points:**

- In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:

- Chasing rainbows: The illusion of the big win

- The unpalatable truth is that these victories aren’t common, and are frequently incorrect. There are a number of contributing factors:

- A penny saved is a penny earned

- Product owners use the product differently than the typical user, which skews their intuition and causes them to design unhelpful features

**Summary:**  
Training your team to make independent decisions
“It was like the debate of a group of savages as to how to extract a screw from a piece of wood. Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear


**Key Points:**

- Training your team to make independent decisions

- People who are right a lot, they listen a lot, and people who are right a lot, change their mind a lot.

- People who are right seek to dis-confirm their most profoundly-held convictions, which is very unnatural for humans.

- Jeff Bezos

- I wish more folks shared how they train their teams and operationalize independent decision making. Here’s my short list.

- Engineering overhead. For each feature you ship with a holdout, you’re committing to support an if-then-else fork in your code. For a fast moving team, having to support multiple code paths makes the test and debug matrix large. Shorter holdouts help make this manageable. When your legacy code path breaks — if you don’t find and fix it swiftly, your holdout results become untrustworthy.

- Opportunity cost. When you ship features that increase revenue or retention, a large holdout means leaving those gains on the table. There’s also dissatisfaction you cause when someone sees a friend with a shiny new feature that they don’t have.

- Monitoring. Holdouts are typically analyzed in detail only at the end of the holdout period. It’s useful to check in on them at a regular cadence (e.g. monthly) to make sure there isn’t anything unexpected that may taint the holdout. A broken control variant impacting only 1% of your users can make the Holdout useless if you only detect it at the end of the holdout period. There’s little point comparing metrics between users with new features and users with a broken experience. The act of checking the performance of the Holdout group can spawn investigations to understand unexpected movements.

- Users, Customer Support & Marketing.For people in the holdout, it is confusing to see friends get a spiffy new feature, while you don’t. It’s important to retire and create new holdouts every cycle — so it’s not the same set of users punished again and again.

### 162. There’s More To Learn From Tests

**Date:** 2022-04-20T18:45:44.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts. ) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way


**Key Points:**

- The Standard: Pre-Launch Experimentation

- It’s common that when people think about testing, they mostly think about pre-launch experimentation:

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

**Summary:**  
The tools that make our jobs possible
When my co-workerSami Springmanand I joined Statsig, we both came from Snowflake- a mature sales organization with every bizdev tool you could dream of. As the first sales people at Statsig, we’ve been building our biztech stack from zero. After some trial and error, we have a list of 4 tools wecan’t live without


**Key Points:**

- The tools that make our jobs possible

- To be totally candid, without Sales Navigator, my job would benext-to-impossible.

- Most of the outbound business we source is either directly through LinkedIn, or from Zoominfo phone numbers/ emails.

- The only caveat for Outreach- the tool is less useful for account execs who aren’t making many cold calls + bulk emails.

- For younger orgs without published contact info, Seamless has been very helpful.

### 168. Reading Experimentation Tea Leaves

**Date:** 2022-03-09T02:11:15.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/reading-experimentation-tea-leaves


**Summary:**  
Making experiment readouts trustworthy
As we talk to many customers, one thing is clear: many common beliefs for product experimentation are plain wrong. These are often theoretical, academic and outdated. They lead teams to believe in a false sense of precision and waste months waiting on a handful of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Making experiment readouts trustworthy

- With great power though comes great responsibility

- You can also useholdouts and backteststo measure the cumulative impact of features over a longer period of time.

- A few tips to make sure you’re not reacting to noise -

- Have a hypothesis on the change you’re making (and expected impact). If you’re rolling out a bug fix to the video player in the Facebook app and see a small reduction in new user signups, it’s unlikely your bug fix is causing that. But if you are seeing an increase in video watch time, then you can usually be sure your fix is working as intended. Many practitioners apply a 95% confidence interval to metrics they’re expecting impact on, and use a 99% confidence interval on other metrics.

**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

**Date:** 2021-10-20T02:14:39.000Z  
**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
Sales is all about process. I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel


**Key Points:**

- Nail your pitch

- I pitch to my mom. If she doesn’t understand it, I still have work to do.

- For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”

- Don’t reinvent the wheel

- Spend the 10 minutes to build out a great email, save it, andmake sure you never write that email again.

### 179. User-Level vs. Device-Level Experiments with Statsig

**Date:** 2021-10-15T03:47:36.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/user-level-vs-device-level-experiments


**Summary:**  
A common challenge in A/B testing arises when we want to track customers from logged-out to logged-in states. Consider, for example, testing a new variant of the account creation flow. This begins with logged-out customers, but we also want to monitor key metrics and events once they complete the flow and log in


**Key Points:**

- Comparing key metrics across test and control groups requires joining 2 different sets of logs: Exposures and events.

- Exposures:Every time we run a check to determine which experience is delivered to a user (e.g.: test or control), we create a log containing:

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Group: The experiment group they were placed in

### 193. My Five Favorite Things About Swift

**Date:** 2021-05-11T07:20:26.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/my-five-favorite-things-about-swift


**Summary:**  
Statsigstrives to empower all developers to ship features faster, so naturally one of the first milestones for us was to provide an SDK for iOS development. I started doing iOS development at Facebook, which only used Objective-C for its iOS apps. But given Swift’s growing popularity (Apple’s own adoption has been growing quickly), we decided to offer and write our SDK natively in Swift


**Key Points:**

- Swift is much more readable

- NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;

- NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;

- NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];

- Swift supports modern language features

### 194. Pitfalls of Multi-arm Experiments

**Date:** 2021-05-04T03:40:13.000Z  
**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/pitfalls-of-multi-arm-experiments


**Summary:**  
Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups
As companies become more comfortable with running AB tests, they often consider simultaneously testing more than one variation. It’s called a multi-arm experiment, also known as multi-group and A/B/n (ABn) testing (but should not be confused withmulti-armed bandit experiments, hopefully the topic of a later blog post). Multi-arm testing involves two or more test groups (eg


**Key Points:**

- Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups

- Significance is Much More Significant

- Solution #1: Apply a Bonferroni correction

- The Bonferroni correction is risk-adverse solution that errs on avoiding Type I errors at the expense of Type II errors.

- Solution #2: Repeat your experiment

### 195. Why we started Statsig

**Date:** 2021-03-17T08:33:11.000Z  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-we-started-statsig


**Summary:**  
When I joined Facebook, one of the things that surprised me was the autonomy Engineers had in building new products and features, and how this enabled them to move really fast. I was curious how decisions were made around product features, since based on my previous experience, the bulk of the time sink happened inside conference rooms — where experienced engineers and PMs debated the details, made decisions, and wrote design docs, all before the first line of code was even written. Product deve


**Key Points:**

- Product development at Facebook often started with the germ of an idea which was quickly translated into code.

- If people wrote code right away, how did they make sure they were building features users actually wanted?

- Gatekeeper:Allows developers to build features visible only to a targeted set of users. For example, these could bedogfoodersand testers until a feature is ready for public consumption. Engineers will then open it up to a small user base to validate everything is working well before launching to the world.

- And the biggest peace-of-mind comes from knowing that when something goes really wrong at any point,you can easily turn features off in real-time.

- Quick Experiments (A/B):This tool takes the debates out of conference rooms and puts hypotheses to test in production. Instead of endless discussions about the “perfect” design, the amount of flexibility to provide, the corner cases to cover, engineers quickly code up different variants and put them out in front of users. How users interact with the product gives rich insights into what works and what doesn’t.

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
AI is changing how we build software. With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. As teams embed AI deeper into their products, and they're facing a new challenge


**Key Points:**

- AI is changing how we build software.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

- AI breaks this model in two critical ways:

- Today, AI products operate in open-ended domains where "correct" has infinite variations and context matters more than accuracy.

- Teams are operating without the foundation they used to rely on: the ability to rigorously test software in a non-production environment.

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it. You may choose the correct statistical method for your test, carefully plan the sample size needed to achieve adequate power, and thoroughly confirm that your assumptions are met, but none of these efforts will be worth it if your samples are not random


**Key Points:**

- Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it?

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights. However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. This approach creates a bottleneck, delaying the launch of new experiments until the ongoing one is completed


**Key Points:**

- In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights.

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- The illustration below outlines two possible scenarios for this kind of test:

**Summary:**  
A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset. The world of A/B testing is brutal. Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time


**Key Points:**

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- These mindset principles are what I believe separate the best A/B testers from the rest.

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built. We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. It’s not an exaggeration to say thatevery leading AI application relies on systematic A/B testingto test, launch, and optimize their prod


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- It’s not an exaggeration to say thatevery leading AI application relies on systematic A/B testingto test, launch, and optimize their product.

- Now, as AI takes on more of the “build” in the build > measure > learn loop,measurement, optimization, and iteration become even more critical.

- We've noticed some particularly interesting trends in how traditional experimentation is evolving to support AI development.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

### 14. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
When we first started Statsig, we had one infra engineer and a highly manual process. Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. You know that meme: “If your infra dev got hit by a bus, would your company survive


**Key Points:**

- The answer was yes, but it took a lot of clever design decisions and tooling.

- You can think of this process in three main phases. We’ll walk through each in detail, but in a nutshell:

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

**Key Points:**

- Great products come from intuition guided by data, not intuition versus data.

- I’ve always been excited by the power of data storytelling.

- The uphill battle for metrics adoption

- As a champion for metrics, I’d often encountered resistance.

The challenge of proving value
When I joined Statsig as PM for our SDKs team, I faced a daunting reality: much of my engineering team had been th


**Key Points:**

- The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them.

- This fear isn't unique to me. I've seen it repeatedly in conversations with other PMs, including many of our customers.

- The natural response to this anxiety is to try to prove your worth through control.

- The two paths for product leaders

- When facing this credibility gap, product managers typically choose between two paths:

**Summary:**  
How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale. Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Namely, “How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale


**Key Points:**

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- At a high-level, our solution works by replicating the user-property updates in Bigtable into a Type 2 SCD BigQuery table. Here’s how it works:

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture. When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. My metrics-focused foundation
My tech career began as a Growth Manager at Rupeek, a Series-A fintech startup in India


**Key Points:**

- The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture.

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- This revealed the true PM dilemma: It's easy to say 'focus on outcomes', but much harder to identify which outcomes matter.

- This created three key problems:

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 19. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
The distinction between “do no harm” and “do good” goals significantly impacts the type of test you choose and the likelihood of obtaining a meaningful result. Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- Here are some situations where non-inferiority testing can be particularly relevant:

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- After setting the margin (Δ) it is time to formulate the hypotheses for a right-tail test:

As a data scientist at Uber, I enjoyed the process of building a deep understanding of the products I worked on: analyzing data, presenting insights and making r


**Key Points:**

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

- While I was confident in my product strategy, the root of the issue washow I approached execution.

- By polishing a "perfect" plan before involving senior stakeholders, I created two critical problems:

- What I should have done was ship thin slices early:releaseminimal viable productsthat tested core hypotheses andgenerated real user feedback.

- By getting something tangible in front of users and stakeholders quickly, PMs can:

### 21. Statsig secures series C funding to bring science to the art of product development

**Date:** 2025-05-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
Product development used to be an art. A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. That simply doesn’t cut it today


**Key Points:**

- Product development used to be an art.

- With this investment, we’re doubling down on our mission to help every product team embrace the science of building great products.

- Building products today can get messy. Why?

- Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.

- Large teams create misalignment:Multiple stakeholders, disjointed workflows, and scattered data lead to endless debates instead of decisive action.

### 24. Continuous promotion for infrastructure with Statsig and Pulumi

**Date:** 2025-04-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact. Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics


**Key Points:**

- Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact.

- When are Release Pipelines used?

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

### 25. Addressing complexity in enterprise-scale experimentation

**Date:** 2025-04-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands
For a startup shipping one feature a month, an A/B test is a neat side project. At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude


**Key Points:**

- Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands

- Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude.

- Coverage: What fraction of product change is truly tested?

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

### 27. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them. At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Every new server-side feature meant copying and pasting evaluation logic into 10 repos, wrangling language quirks, and fighting version drift


**Key Points:**

- If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them.

- With this change, we're now seeingup to 5x evaluation speeds(!)—and that's just the cherry on top of all the code sustainability benefits.

- Figure 1:In our legacy model, every new server-side feature required duplicating evaluation logic code in all 10 server SDKs.

- Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:

- We used the following FFIs (Foreign Function Interfaces) for this Rust core project:

### 31. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As an outsider to the SEO world, I'd always seen it as a world of convention: add your meta descriptions, set your canonicals, write something novel, and the traffic will come. It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Certainly, all of the above (metas, canonicals, novel content) are best practices—but if they're well-known principles, can they really se


**Key Points:**

- How can the algorithm—and its many rules—allow you to AB test like you normally would?

- First, and perhaps obviously, we have to follow the rules of the algorithm.

- For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:

- On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-ab-testing-is-ultimately-qualitative


**Summary:**  
A/B testing is essential for data-driven teams, but its real value isn’t just in the metrics—it’s in the ultimately qualitative decisions that those metrics enable. Understanding the bigger picture
Real-world decision-making doesn’t happen in a statistical vacuum. People with diverse perspectives have to debate options in a room, weighing pros and cons between multiple (sometimes conflicting) objectives, many of which can't be captured in a single metric


**Key Points:**

- Understanding the bigger picture

- The limitations of data and the role of expert judgment

- A balanced approach: Numbers and narrative

- Talk to the pros, become a proWe're on standby to help you start using your data to make better decisions.Let's chat

### 39. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. Bayesian alternatives promise more intuitive “probability of being better” metrics and flexible sequential monitoring


**Key Points:**

- Introduction

- This paper distinguishes two broad ways in which “informedness” can be brought into Bayesian A/B testing:

- Therefore, in applications, we should be careful about the misuse of Bayesian without understanding their misuse:

- Our goal is to clarify these trade-offs and suggest ways to harness Bayesian methods responsibly. For such purposes, we recommend two approaches:

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

### 42. Why data-driven marketing attribution models don&#39;t work as promised

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/data-driven-marketing-attribution-shortcomings


**Summary:**  
From huge enterprises to niche e-commerce brands, every marketer grapples with the same fundamental question: Where should we invest our marketing budget for the greatest return. Ideally, you’d like a tidy calculation that says, “Channel A accounts for 25% of conversions, Channel B for 40%, Channel C for 10%,” and so on. That’s the allure of marketing attribution: pinpointing exactly which touchpoints move the needle and which are mere distractions


**Key Points:**

- The problem: Evaluating marketing spend in a complex landscape

- What data-driven models promise

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-to-calculate-statistical-significance


**Summary:**  
You’ve run an A/B test and the results are in, now what. You’ve got the data and now you have to analyze the results. Your goal: Determine whether A is different from B (a classic two-sided hypothesis test)


**Key Points:**

- You’ve run an A/B test and the results are in, now what?

- In hypothesis testing, we have a pair of hypotheses called the null and the alternate hypothesis. The null hypothesis is simply:

- In a two-sided test:There is no difference between A and B, or

- In a two-sided test:There is no difference between A and B, or

- In a one-sided test:B (Test) is not better than A (Control).

### 60. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment. However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Issues like website crashes when serving the control version could prevent the SDK from sending exposure events to Statsig.

- However, these tools have been limited to analyzing a preset list of dimensions, such assdk_type,browser,country, andos.

- Step 1:In your project settings, list the custom dimensions you want to analyze.

- Step 2:Navigate to the Diagnostics tab and open the Experiment Health Checks.

**Author:** Kane Luo  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/interaction-effect-detection


**Summary:**  
Statsig now offersinteraction effect detectionto uncover the hidden effects of experiments on each other. To accelerate experimentation, medium to large companies run hundreds of A/B tests simultaneously, aiming to isolate and measure the impact of each change, also known as the "main effect. "
However, when multiple tests target the same area of your product, they can influence one another, resulting in either overestimation or underestimation of metric changes


**Key Points:**

- Statsig now offersinteraction effect detectionto uncover the hidden effects of experiments on each other.

- Consider these scenarios: two teams at your company are running two experiments concurrently, but they are unaware of what other teams are testing.

- We offer a view of the traffic distribution between the experiments. Here is a screenshot of Statsig UI:

- My experiments are interacting—now what?

- There are several options for next steps:

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/when-allocation-point-and-exposure-point-differ


**Summary:**  
During a job interview, I posed the following scenario to the candidates: A company wants to test a new variation on their website’s landing page by adding a feature at the bottom. Since this feature isn’t visible when the page loads, users in the test group might leave before scrolling down to see it. Consequently, some users may never actually be exposed to the new version of the page

### 82. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products. In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms


**Key Points:**

- Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products.

- Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms.

- Based on this,I was initially fairly cynical about funnels. It’s true that funnels do have some fundamental limitations:

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

**Date:** 2024-09-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sedona Duggal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/how-much-does-an-experimentation-platform-cost


**Summary:**  
Comparing pricing across experimentation platforms can be tricky, with different pricing structures and usage tiers to decipher. To simplify this process, we made a detailed pricing model that breaks down costs across the most popular experimentation platforms, complete with all our assumptions and calculations. The bottom line: Statsig is the most cost-effective and scalable option out there


**Key Points:**

- Comparing pricing across experimentation platforms can be tricky, with different pricing structures and usage tiers to decipher.

- Experimentation platforms use different usage metrics to price their platforms, making it difficult to compare pricing models.

- In order to make it clearer, we made the following assumptions to create a comparable view of pricing across platforms:

- Monthly Active Users (MAU) act as a standardized benchmark across platforms. It is assumed that 100% of MAU are tracked (monthly tracked users (MTU))

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-allies-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
For much of my career in data science, I had a sort of shared understanding with my colleagues that the worst part of the job is dealing with a constant deluge of questions. These questions range from the actually problematic (a stakeholder asking if you can do a drill down to find a “win” in their experiment results) to great questions that just require some mental bandwidth to answer well and randomize you from the work you were planning on doing. In my two years at Statsig, I’ve totally chang


**Key Points:**

- The stakeholders I’m usually working with at Statsig don’t work at Statsig.

- This, funnily enough, leads to a reinforcing loop; as we demonstrate a willingness to collaborate, people have more product asks. This is agoodthing.

- Introducing Product AnalyticsLearn how leading companies stay on top of every metric as they roll out features.Read more

- When I see a customer question more than once, this is a near-instant trigger for me to update documentation and reach out to the design team.

### 170. Switchback experiments: Overview and considerations

**Date:** 2023-11-14T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/switchback-experiments


**Summary:**  
When should someone use a switchback test instead of an A/B test. Switchback experiments are a way to measure the impact of a change when network effects render traditional A/B tests impractical, as is often the case in 2-sided marketplace products. A canonical example of this scenario comes from ridesharing services likeLyft: All the riders in an area share the same supply of drivers, and vice versa


**Key Points:**

- When should someone use a switchback test instead of an A/B test?

- Since the test and control groups are not independent, a simple A/B test will produce inaccurate results.

- Questions about switchback testing?

- At the most basic level, the minimum requirement for setting up a switchback experiment is determining the time interval for switching.

- The standard t-test commonly used for traditional A/B tests is not recommended for switchback. experiments:

Build your own in-house platform
Build your own in-house platform
Fork an open-source platform and self-host it
Fork an open-source platform and self-host it
Go buy a cloud solution
Go buy a cloud solution

### 180. Cumulative impact versus big wins: Chasing the experimentation rainbow

**Date:** 2023-06-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cumulative-impact-experimentation-wins


**Summary:**  
You don’t experiment for wins
In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:
This FOMO-engendering content has a point. Experimentation is a valuable tool for understanding what kind of changes work for your product; with that knowledge in hand, you can more reliably pick a good future direction. However, in practice—and especially in product experimentation—the real wins come from not losing


**Key Points:**

- In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:

- Chasing rainbows: The illusion of the big win

- The unpalatable truth is that these victories aren’t common, and are frequently incorrect. There are a number of contributing factors:

- A penny saved is a penny earned

- Product owners use the product differently than the typical user, which skews their intuition and causes them to design unhelpful features

**Key Points:**

- Heads up: No number-crunching abilities are required to grasp this post.

- If you have a fear of algebraic symbols, your secret is safe with me.

### 185. Feature flag solutions: Building vs. buying

**Date:** 2023-04-02T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-vs-buy-feature-flags-gates-experiment-platform


**Summary:**  
In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig. I’ve observed some patterns and developed some standard questions that I ask these customers, which I think objectively helps them begin to understand which of the build and/or buy options is right for them. Longer term I plan to create a calculator or survey that can help people understand which option they should prioritize, but in the meantime I want to share


**Key Points:**

- In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig.

- Building an experimentation platform requires specialized engineering, data science and data engineering skills and resources.

- Have your team members built similar systems before?

- What kind of infrastructure and architecture is your team familiar with?

- After surveying your team, if the answer to this question doesn’t inspire confidence,you should consider buying, or a hybrid build and buy.

**Author:** Matt Garnes  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/metric-directionality


**Summary:**  
For most measurements we make in product development, we want the value to go “up and to the right. ”
Daily active users, revenue, clicks on “add to shopping cart,” etc. Within Statsig, we celebrate these increases when they are statistically significant with a deep, satisfying, green color:
When up isn’t good
But what about when thisisn’tthe case


**Key Points:**

- For most measurements we make in product development, we want the value to go “up and to the right.”

- But what about when thisisn’tthe case?

- You might want to measure things that are not always better when they go up, like

- For all of these, if we see significant increases, we want everyone using the platform to recognize that this is not desired.

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/leading-a-team-of-lions


**Summary:**  
Training your team to make independent decisions
“It was like the debate of a group of savages as to how to extract a screw from a piece of wood. Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear


**Key Points:**

- Training your team to make independent decisions

- People who are right a lot, they listen a lot, and people who are right a lot, change their mind a lot.

- People who are right seek to dis-confirm their most profoundly-held convictions, which is very unnatural for humans.

- Jeff Bezos

- I wish more folks shared how they train their teams and operationalize independent decision making. Here’s my short list.

**Author:** Tore Hanssen  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-do-my-facebook-groups-look-different


**Summary:**  
By now, most people realize that when they open Facebook or Instagram on their phone, their experience is very different than the person next to them. It goes deeper than just the content that you see, and the ranking algorithms backings those — the buttons you have to click, the way a post with multiple photos shows up, or even theshade of the bluemight be different. At Statsig, we’ve been working to help any company run these same types of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Trying to experiment on a different unit type than a “user”? Or just miss GK::forID()?Try out customIDs on Statsig.

### 205. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool. The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Within Workplace, all you had to do was type #m followed by the name of your macro and the macro bot would respond to your comment or message with the macro associated with that name


**Key Points:**

- One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool.

- But why have a dedicated tool instead of sending the image yourself each time? A few main reasons:

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Create a Custom Integration within Workplace

**Summary:**  
A Bayesian exploration of road rage methodology, and its important applications to experimentation
Disclaimer: this is in good fun and I don’t advocate road rage. You, dear reader, are driving somewhere nice. However, the driver behind you is determined to make you have a bad day; they’ve come up uncomfortably close behind you and you’re pretty sure they’re a bad driver who should feel bad about how they’re driving


**Key Points:**

- A Bayesian exploration of road rage methodology, and its important applications to experimentation

- Disclaimer: this is in good fun and I don’t advocate road rage.

- Soon, they pass you, and the age-old question rings through your brain:

- Do I need to let this person know that they’re a jerk?

- The decision above is of course a personal one, but it does have some interesting inputs.

### 208. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
An opinionated guide on using Holdouts
Feature Level Holdouts
Good teams move fast. They’re trying several ideas at any given time. When they find something that works, they ship it and find the next idea to try


**Key Points:**

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Engineering overhead. For each feature you ship with a holdout, you’re committing to support an if-then-else fork in your code. For a fast moving team, having to support multiple code paths makes the test and debug matrix large. Shorter holdouts help make this manageable. When your legacy code path breaks — if you don’t find and fix it swiftly, your holdout results become untrustworthy.

- Opportunity cost. When you ship features that increase revenue or retention, a large holdout means leaving those gains on the table. There’s also dissatisfaction you cause when someone sees a friend with a shiny new feature that they don’t have.

- Monitoring. Holdouts are typically analyzed in detail only at the end of the holdout period. It’s useful to check in on them at a regular cadence (e.g. monthly) to make sure there isn’t anything unexpected that may taint the holdout. A broken control variant impacting only 1% of your users can make the Holdout useless if you only detect it at the end of the holdout period. There’s little point comparing metrics between users with new features and users with a broken experience. The act of checking the performance of the Holdout group can spawn investigations to understand unexpected movements.

- Users, Customer Support & Marketing.For people in the holdout, it is confusing to see friends get a spiffy new feature, while you don’t. It’s important to retire and create new holdouts every cycle — so it’s not the same set of users punished again and again.

### 209. There’s More To Learn From Tests

**Date:** 2022-04-20T18:45:44.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts. ) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way


**Key Points:**

- The Standard: Pre-Launch Experimentation

- It’s common that when people think about testing, they mostly think about pre-launch experimentation:

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

**Summary:**  
The tools that make our jobs possible
When my co-workerSami Springmanand I joined Statsig, we both came from Snowflake- a mature sales organization with every bizdev tool you could dream of. As the first sales people at Statsig, we’ve been building our biztech stack from zero. After some trial and error, we have a list of 4 tools wecan’t live without


**Key Points:**

- The tools that make our jobs possible

- To be totally candid, without Sales Navigator, my job would benext-to-impossible.

- Most of the outbound business we source is either directly through LinkedIn, or from Zoominfo phone numbers/ emails.

- The only caveat for Outreach- the tool is less useful for account execs who aren’t making many cold calls + bulk emails.

- For younger orgs without published contact info, Seamless has been very helpful.

### 217. Reading Experimentation Tea Leaves

**Date:** 2022-03-09T02:11:15.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/reading-experimentation-tea-leaves


**Summary:**  
Making experiment readouts trustworthy
As we talk to many customers, one thing is clear: many common beliefs for product experimentation are plain wrong. These are often theoretical, academic and outdated. They lead teams to believe in a false sense of precision and waste months waiting on a handful of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Making experiment readouts trustworthy

- With great power though comes great responsibility

- You can also useholdouts and backteststo measure the cumulative impact of features over a longer period of time.

- A few tips to make sure you’re not reacting to noise -

- Have a hypothesis on the change you’re making (and expected impact). If you’re rolling out a bug fix to the video player in the Facebook app and see a small reduction in new user signups, it’s unlikely your bug fix is causing that. But if you are seeing an increase in video watch time, then you can usually be sure your fix is working as intended. Many practitioners apply a 95% confidence interval to metrics they’re expecting impact on, and use a 99% confidence interval on other metrics.

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/failing-fast-kiss-a-lot-of-frogs


**Summary:**  
Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast. In a startup, everybody builds stuff (code, websites, sales lists, etc) — and part of the building process is accepting that not everything you make is good. But, switching from outcome to learning-oriented can speed up productivity, and make it easier to identify good ideas


**Key Points:**

- Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast.

- But, this is when I learned the value of minimum viable products (MVPs).

- Every feature is well intentioned but…

- Tavouris an app that helps fill your fridge with unique, craft beers you can’t find locally. They use Statsig to manage features and run experiments.

- Tavour decided to tweak the feature to let users see more auto complete suggestions without having to scroll.

**Summary:**  
In the summer of 2021, HBO accidentally sent an email to millions of past and current subscribers with the body “This message is used by integration tests only”. The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments. For continuous deployment, teams often create environments for development, staging and production


**Key Points:**

- The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments.

- Two philosophies : Per Environment Config vs Global Config

- Some advantages of the Global Config approach (with environment specific exceptions) include…

- This is useful in production where stability is paramount, but can slow down iteration in development and staging environments.

Challenging prevailing narratives
You’re tasked with deciding where to go for dinner with your friends. You whip out your phone, fire up Yelp, and scroll through nearby restaurants. Piling on some filters, you settle on an option that looks good


**Key Points:**

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
Sales is all about process. I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel


**Key Points:**

- Nail your pitch

- I pitch to my mom. If she doesn’t understand it, I still have work to do.

- For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”

- Don’t reinvent the wheel

- Spend the 10 minutes to build out a great email, save it, andmake sure you never write that email again.

**Author:** Tim Chan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/pitfalls-of-multi-arm-experiments


**Summary:**  
Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups
As companies become more comfortable with running AB tests, they often consider simultaneously testing more than one variation. It’s called a multi-arm experiment, also known as multi-group and A/B/n (ABn) testing (but should not be confused withmulti-armed bandit experiments, hopefully the topic of a later blog post). Multi-arm testing involves two or more test groups (eg


**Key Points:**

- Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups

- Significance is Much More Significant

- Solution #1: Apply a Bonferroni correction

- The Bonferroni correction is risk-adverse solution that errs on avoiding Type I errors at the expense of Type II errors.

- Solution #2: Repeat your experiment

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools. Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift. With your current traffic, that meanseleven weeksof waiting to gather enough user data

### 13. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As A/B testing analysts, we often encounter skewed distributions for our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), especially when dealing with revenue metrics. It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type II error (β):The probability of failing to detect a true improvement when one exists.

### 14. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. Bayesian alternatives promise more intuitive “probability of being better” metrics and flexible sequential monitoring


**Key Points:**

- Introduction

- This paper distinguishes two broad ways in which “informedness” can be brought into Bayesian A/B testing:

- Therefore, in applications, we should be careful about the misuse of Bayesian without understanding their misuse:

- Our goal is to clarify these trade-offs and suggest ways to harness Bayesian methods responsibly. For such purposes, we recommend two approaches:

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-rollouts-examples


**Summary:**  
When I was a freshman in college, Instagram was all the rage. Instagram was becoming the primary medium for keeping tabs on friends and influencers alike—perceiving the world through their iPhone lenses, in a way. A simple scroll through an Instagram feed would inform me what my friends ate for dinner, where my ex’s family vacationed, and which Uggs Kim Kardashian wanted me to buy


**Key Points:**

- When I was a freshman in college, Instagram was all the rage.

- It was truly the platform for keeping up—until it made me fall behind.

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products. In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms


**Key Points:**

- Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products.

- Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms.

- Based on this,I was initially fairly cynical about funnels. It’s true that funnels do have some fundamental limitations:

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

**Key Points:**

- How do you reduce your cloud compute costs without using a third-party vendor?

- Anyone who has optimized cloud compute costs knows that spot nodes can significantly reduce your bill.

- However, spot pricing isn't always intuitive: better hardware isn't necessarily more expensive and pricing fluctuates significantly across regions.

- While some SaaS companies offer automated optimization of spot node selection, these services typically have notable drawbacks:

- Loss of Control: You're entrusting third-party providers with your node management, which could risk disrupting your workflows with opaque algorithms

### 10. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
AI is changing how we build software. With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. As teams embed AI deeper into their products, and they're facing a new challenge


**Key Points:**

- AI is changing how we build software.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

- AI breaks this model in two critical ways:

- Today, AI products operate in open-ended domains where "correct" has infinite variations and context matters more than accuracy.

- Teams are operating without the foundation they used to rely on: the ability to rigorously test software in a non-production environment.

### 11. The more the merrier? The problem of multiple comparisons in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-07-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
The problem of multiple comparisons represents a fundamental clash between statistical inference and human intuition. After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results. The goal of this blog is to explain why our intuition leads us astray in this case and to clarify the multiple comparisons problem


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- Figure 1.Probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (alpha) as a function of the number of tests.

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

- Now that we understand why multiple comparisons are problematic, let’s look at some common scenarios in A/B testing where this issue often arises:

### 12. Randomization: The ABC’s of A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-06-30T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it. You may choose the correct statistical method for your test, carefully plan the sample size needed to achieve adequate power, and thoroughly confirm that your assumptions are met, but none of these efforts will be worth it if your samples are not random


**Key Points:**

- Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it?

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

- Platforms like Statsig havebuilt-in featuresand tools that help you configure your randomization techniques according to your experimentation needs.

### 13. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools. Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift. With your current traffic, that meanseleven weeksof waiting to gather enough user data


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

### 14. You can have it all: Parallel testing with A/B tests

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights. However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. This approach creates a bottleneck, delaying the launch of new experiments until the ongoing one is completed


**Key Points:**

- In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights.

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- The illustration below outlines two possible scenarios for this kind of test:

**Summary:**  
A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset. The world of A/B testing is brutal. Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time


**Key Points:**

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- These mindset principles are what I believe separate the best A/B testers from the rest.

When we first started Statsig, we had one infra engineer and a highly manual process. Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. You know that meme: “If your infra dev got hit by a bus, would your company survive


**Key Points:**

- The answer was yes, but it took a lot of clever design decisions and tooling.

- You can think of this process in three main phases. We’ll walk through each in detail, but in a nutshell:

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

**Summary:**  
The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them. After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. The challenge of proving value
When I joined Statsig as PM for our SDKs team, I faced a daunting reality: much of my engineering team had been th


**Key Points:**

- The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them.

- This fear isn't unique to me. I've seen it repeatedly in conversations with other PMs, including many of our customers.

- The natural response to this anxiety is to try to prove your worth through control.

- The two paths for product leaders

- When facing this credibility gap, product managers typically choose between two paths:

**Summary:**  
How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale. Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Namely, “How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale


**Key Points:**

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- At a high-level, our solution works by replicating the user-property updates in Bigtable into a Type 2 SCD BigQuery table. Here’s how it works:

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

### 20. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
The distinction between “do no harm” and “do good” goals significantly impacts the type of test you choose and the likelihood of obtaining a meaningful result. Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- Here are some situations where non-inferiority testing can be particularly relevant:

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- After setting the margin (Δ) it is time to formulate the hypotheses for a right-tail test:

**Summary:**  
Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management. After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product.

As a data scientist at Uber, I enjoyed the process of building a deep understanding of the products I worked on: analyzing data, presenting insights and making r


**Key Points:**

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

- While I was confident in my product strategy, the root of the issue washow I approached execution.

- By polishing a "perfect" plan before involving senior stakeholders, I created two critical problems:

- What I should have done was ship thin slices early:releaseminimal viable productsthat tested core hypotheses andgenerated real user feedback.

- By getting something tangible in front of users and stakeholders quickly, PMs can:

### 22. Statsig secures series C funding to bring science to the art of product development

**Date:** 2025-05-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
Product development used to be an art. A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. That simply doesn’t cut it today


**Key Points:**

- Product development used to be an art.

- With this investment, we’re doubling down on our mission to help every product team embrace the science of building great products.

- Building products today can get messy. Why?

- Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.

- Large teams create misalignment:Multiple stakeholders, disjointed workflows, and scattered data lead to endless debates instead of decisive action.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact. Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics


**Key Points:**

- Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact.

- When are Release Pipelines used?

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands
For a startup shipping one feature a month, an A/B test is a neat side project. At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude


**Key Points:**

- Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands

- Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude.

- Coverage: What fraction of product change is truly tested?

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

### 28. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them. At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Every new server-side feature meant copying and pasting evaluation logic into 10 repos, wrangling language quirks, and fighting version drift


**Key Points:**

- If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them.

- With this change, we're now seeingup to 5x evaluation speeds(!)—and that's just the cherry on top of all the code sustainability benefits.

- Figure 1:In our legacy model, every new server-side feature required duplicating evaluation logic code in all 10 server SDKs.

- Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:

- We used the following FFIs (Foreign Function Interfaces) for this Rust core project:

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
If you’d told me a decade ago that software teams would someday run more experiments than marketing, I’d have assumed you were joking—or pitching a dystopian adtech startup. Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. ThinkOptimizely's founding story—testing every piece of marketing in the Obama presidential campaign


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Author's Note: You will notice a lot of formulas in this article. Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. This survey summarizes these models as objectively as I could, but I'm going to publish other articles with my opinions


**Key Points:**

- Author's Note: You will notice a lot of formulas in this article.

- Brief history of marketing attribution in digital channels

- Major attribution models: rule-based vs. data-driven

- The first channel essentially gets the entire conversion value (often set to 1 or to the revenue amount).

### 32. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As an outsider to the SEO world, I'd always seen it as a world of convention: add your meta descriptions, set your canonicals, write something novel, and the traffic will come. It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Certainly, all of the above (metas, canonicals, novel content) are best practices—but if they're well-known principles, can they really se


**Key Points:**

- How can the algorithm—and its many rules—allow you to AB test like you normally would?

- First, and perhaps obviously, we have to follow the rules of the algorithm.

- For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:

- On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

### 38. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As A/B testing analysts, we often encounter skewed distributions for our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), especially when dealing with revenue metrics. It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type II error (β):The probability of failing to detect a true improvement when one exists.

**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags aren't ruining your codebase. Lack of cleanup accountability is. Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others


**Key Points:**

- Feature flags aren't ruining your codebase. Lack of cleanup accountability is.

- If you’ve ever tried coding with feature flags, there’s a good chance this thought has crossed your mind at least once:

**Author:** Sid Kumar  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/buying-an-experimentation-platform


**Summary:**  
For most organizations, buying an experimentation platform today is the smarter choice. “Building your own experimentation platform made a lot of sense… five years ago,” says our customer Jared Bauman, Engineering Manager - Core ML at Whatnot, who previously worked on DoorDash’s in-house platform. Over the past few years, several companies have moved away from in-house experimentation tooling and turned to Statsig to scale their experimentation cultures


**Key Points:**

- For most organizations, buying an experimentation platform today is the smarter choice.

- If you're weighing thebuild vs. buydecision, here are some key factors to consider:Get the free guide

### 42. Why data-driven marketing attribution models don&#39;t work as promised

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/data-driven-marketing-attribution-shortcomings


**Summary:**  
From huge enterprises to niche e-commerce brands, every marketer grapples with the same fundamental question: Where should we invest our marketing budget for the greatest return. Ideally, you’d like a tidy calculation that says, “Channel A accounts for 25% of conversions, Channel B for 40%, Channel C for 10%,” and so on. That’s the allure of marketing attribution: pinpointing exactly which touchpoints move the needle and which are mere distractions


**Key Points:**

- The problem: Evaluating marketing spend in a complex landscape

- What data-driven models promise

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products. In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms


**Key Points:**

- Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products.

- Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms.

- Based on this,I was initially fairly cynical about funnels. It’s true that funnels do have some fundamental limitations:

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/demystifying-identity-resolution


**Summary:**  
The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds. The notion of “identity resolution” in the SaaS world continues to be an elusive gold standard that businesses want to solve in order to understand the full scope of customer behaviors across all touch-points. To that end, I promise not to use the term “omnichannel” in this blog


**Key Points:**

- The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds.

- To that end, I promise not to use the term “omnichannel” in this blog.🙂

- A few disclaimers, debunkings, and considerations as we dive in:

- It is strictly impossible to reliably identify a single human interacting anonymously on two different devices that never identify themselves.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-allies-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
For much of my career in data science, I had a sort of shared understanding with my colleagues that the worst part of the job is dealing with a constant deluge of questions. These questions range from the actually problematic (a stakeholder asking if you can do a drill down to find a “win” in their experiment results) to great questions that just require some mental bandwidth to answer well and randomize you from the work you were planning on doing. In my two years at Statsig, I’ve totally chang


**Key Points:**

- The stakeholders I’m usually working with at Statsig don’t work at Statsig.

- This, funnily enough, leads to a reinforcing loop; as we demonstrate a willingness to collaborate, people have more product asks. This is agoodthing.

- Introducing Product AnalyticsLearn how leading companies stay on top of every metric as they roll out features.Read more

- When I see a customer question more than once, this is a near-instant trigger for me to update documentation and reach out to the design team.

- This has been especially important as part of theStatsig Warehouse Nativeteam’s process since we’re tightly integrating with customers’ data layer!

**Summary:**  
You don’t experiment for wins
In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:
This FOMO-engendering content has a point. Experimentation is a valuable tool for understanding what kind of changes work for your product; with that knowledge in hand, you can more reliably pick a good future direction. However, in practice—and especially in product experimentation—the real wins come from not losing


**Key Points:**

- In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:

- Chasing rainbows: The illusion of the big win

- The unpalatable truth is that these victories aren’t common, and are frequently incorrect. There are a number of contributing factors:

- A penny saved is a penny earned

- Product owners use the product differently than the typical user, which skews their intuition and causes them to design unhelpful features

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-vs-buy-feature-flags-gates-experiment-platform


**Summary:**  
In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig. I’ve observed some patterns and developed some standard questions that I ask these customers, which I think objectively helps them begin to understand which of the build and/or buy options is right for them. Longer term I plan to create a calculator or survey that can help people understand which option they should prioritize, but in the meantime I want to share


**Key Points:**

- In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig.

- Building an experimentation platform requires specialized engineering, data science and data engineering skills and resources.

- Have your team members built similar systems before?

- What kind of infrastructure and architecture is your team familiar with?

- After surveying your team, if the answer to this question doesn’t inspire confidence,you should consider buying, or a hybrid build and buy.

But what about when thisisn’tthe case


**Key Points:**

- For most measurements we make in product development, we want the value to go “up and to the right.”

- But what about when thisisn’tthe case?

- You might want to measure things that are not always better when they go up, like

- For all of these, if we see significant increases, we want everyone using the platform to recognize that this is not desired.

- From there, simply choose whether an increase or a decrease is desired for this metric, and confirm!

### 176. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool. The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Within Workplace, all you had to do was type #m followed by the name of your macro and the macro bot would respond to your comment or message with the macro associated with that name


**Key Points:**

- One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool.

- But why have a dedicated tool instead of sending the image yourself each time? A few main reasons:

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Create a Custom Integration within Workplace

**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/using-pulse-time-series-for-deeper-insights


**Summary:**  
TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment. Sometimes, a brief scan of the color coded score card is enough to validate that all metrics behave as expected, and we quickly proceed with the launch. Other times, however, a more detailed understanding is required before deciding on next steps


**Key Points:**

- TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment.

- Does my experiment have a novelty effect? Do users try out the new feature once and never again?

- Is there pre-experiment bias in this metric? Was that lift there even before we launched the feature?

- This view shows the metric impact on each calendar day without aggregating days together. It’s a good one to check if we have concerns such as:

- Does the feature have a different impact on weekends vs. weekdays?

### 179. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
An opinionated guide on using Holdouts
Feature Level Holdouts
Good teams move fast. They’re trying several ideas at any given time. When they find something that works, they ship it and find the next idea to try


**Key Points:**

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Engineering overhead. For each feature you ship with a holdout, you’re committing to support an if-then-else fork in your code. For a fast moving team, having to support multiple code paths makes the test and debug matrix large. Shorter holdouts help make this manageable. When your legacy code path breaks — if you don’t find and fix it swiftly, your holdout results become untrustworthy.

- Opportunity cost. When you ship features that increase revenue or retention, a large holdout means leaving those gains on the table. There’s also dissatisfaction you cause when someone sees a friend with a shiny new feature that they don’t have.

- Monitoring. Holdouts are typically analyzed in detail only at the end of the holdout period. It’s useful to check in on them at a regular cadence (e.g. monthly) to make sure there isn’t anything unexpected that may taint the holdout. A broken control variant impacting only 1% of your users can make the Holdout useless if you only detect it at the end of the holdout period. There’s little point comparing metrics between users with new features and users with a broken experience. The act of checking the performance of the Holdout group can spawn investigations to understand unexpected movements.

- Users, Customer Support & Marketing.For people in the holdout, it is confusing to see friends get a spiffy new feature, while you don’t. It’s important to retire and create new holdouts every cycle — so it’s not the same set of users punished again and again.

The tools that make our jobs possible
When my co-workerSami Springmanand I joined Statsig, we both came from Snowflake- a mature sales organization with every bizdev tool you could dream of. As the first sales people at Statsig, we’ve been building our biztech stack from zero. After some trial and error, we have a list of 4 tools wecan’t live without


**Key Points:**

- The tools that make our jobs possible

- To be totally candid, without Sales Navigator, my job would benext-to-impossible.

- Most of the outbound business we source is either directly through LinkedIn, or from Zoominfo phone numbers/ emails.

- The only caveat for Outreach- the tool is less useful for account execs who aren’t making many cold calls + bulk emails.

- For younger orgs without published contact info, Seamless has been very helpful.

### 196. How Statsig Designs SDKs for Different Application Environments

**Date:** 2021-10-22T05:10:07.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence. An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in. Specifically, we design any SDK for either client-side or server-side applications


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

- Curious what the differences are? Read on!

- Serves a single user at a time

- Not in a secure environment, i.e. assume everything is public

- The device is not always connected to the Internet

### 197. User-Level vs. Device-Level Experiments with Statsig

**Date:** 2021-10-15T03:47:36.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/user-level-vs-device-level-experiments


**Summary:**  
A common challenge in A/B testing arises when we want to track customers from logged-out to logged-in states. Consider, for example, testing a new variant of the account creation flow. This begins with logged-out customers, but we also want to monitor key metrics and events once they complete the flow and log in


**Key Points:**

- Comparing key metrics across test and control groups requires joining 2 different sets of logs: Exposures and events.

- Exposures:Every time we run a check to determine which experience is delivered to a user (e.g.: test or control), we create a log containing:

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Group: The experiment group they were placed in

### 214. RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

**Date:** 2021-05-05T05:41:52.000Z  
**Author:** Rodrigo Roim  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ruid-time-travel-safe-distributed-unique-64-bit-ids-generated-in-rust


**Summary:**  
RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust
RUIDs (Rodrigo’s Unique Identifiers) are 64 bit ids mathematically guaranteed to be unique when generated within the sameRUID root. Check it out on GitHub. AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration


**Key Points:**

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

- The canonical version of RUIDs (this repo) uses 41 bits for timestamp, 14 bits for a monotonically increasing sequence, and 9 bits for the root id.

- bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

### 216. Why we started Statsig

**Date:** 2021-03-17T08:33:11.000Z  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-we-started-statsig


**Summary:**  
When I joined Facebook, one of the things that surprised me was the autonomy Engineers had in building new products and features, and how this enabled them to move really fast. I was curious how decisions were made around product features, since based on my previous experience, the bulk of the time sink happened inside conference rooms — where experienced engineers and PMs debated the details, made decisions, and wrote design docs, all before the first line of code was even written. Product deve


**Key Points:**

- Product development at Facebook often started with the germ of an idea which was quickly translated into code.

- If people wrote code right away, how did they make sure they were building features users actually wanted?

- Gatekeeper:Allows developers to build features visible only to a targeted set of users. For example, these could bedogfoodersand testers until a feature is ready for public consumption. Engineers will then open it up to a small user base to validate everything is working well before launching to the world.

- And the biggest peace-of-mind comes from knowing that when something goes really wrong at any point,you can easily turn features off in real-time.

- Quick Experiments (A/B):This tool takes the debates out of conference rooms and puts hypotheses to test in production. Instead of endless discussions about the “perfect” design, the amount of flexibility to provide, the corner cases to cover, engineers quickly code up different variants and put them out in front of users. How users interact with the product gives rich insights into what works and what doesn’t.

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
AI is changing how we build software. With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. As teams embed AI deeper into their products, and they're facing a new challenge


**Key Points:**

- AI is changing how we build software.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

- AI breaks this model in two critical ways:

- Today, AI products operate in open-ended domains where "correct" has infinite variations and context matters more than accuracy.

- Teams are operating without the foundation they used to rely on: the ability to rigorously test software in a non-production environment.

### 8. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools. Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift. With your current traffic, that meanseleven weeksof waiting to gather enough user data


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built. We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. It’s not an exaggeration to say thatevery leading AI application relies on systematic A/B testingto test, launch, and optimize their prod


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- It’s not an exaggeration to say thatevery leading AI application relies on systematic A/B testingto test, launch, and optimize their product.

- Now, as AI takes on more of the “build” in the build > measure > learn loop,measurement, optimization, and iteration become even more critical.

- We've noticed some particularly interesting trends in how traditional experimentation is evolving to support AI development.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
When we first started Statsig, we had one infra engineer and a highly manual process. Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. You know that meme: “If your infra dev got hit by a bus, would your company survive


**Key Points:**

- The answer was yes, but it took a lot of clever design decisions and tooling.

- You can think of this process in three main phases. We’ll walk through each in detail, but in a nutshell:

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale. Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Namely, “How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale


**Key Points:**

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- At a high-level, our solution works by replicating the user-property updates in Bigtable into a Type 2 SCD BigQuery table. Here’s how it works:

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture. When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. My metrics-focused foundation
My tech career began as a Growth Manager at Rupeek, a Series-A fintech startup in India


**Key Points:**

- The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture.

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- This revealed the true PM dilemma: It's easy to say 'focus on outcomes', but much harder to identify which outcomes matter.

- This created three key problems:

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 14. Fail faster, learn faster: Why &#34;done&#34; beats &#34;perfect&#34; in modern product management

**Date:** 2025-05-20T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management. After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. The pressure to get it perfect
As a data scientist at Uber, I enjoyed the process of building a deep understanding of the products I worked on: analyzing data, presenting insights and making r


**Key Points:**

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

- While I was confident in my product strategy, the root of the issue washow I approached execution.

- By polishing a "perfect" plan before involving senior stakeholders, I created two critical problems:

- What I should have done was ship thin slices early:releaseminimal viable productsthat tested core hypotheses andgenerated real user feedback.

- By getting something tangible in front of users and stakeholders quickly, PMs can:

### 15. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
You don’t need to wait a year to know if your feature worked—surrogate metrics let you move fastandstay anchored to long-term outcomes that actually matter. Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. If you bring the predicted values and mean squared error (MSE) of the model used to make these predictions, we’ll accurately account for the model’s prediction error when calculating p-values and confidence intervals


**Key Points:**

- Why are surrogate metrics helpful?

- Surrogate metric best practices

- Validate your predictive model and monitor over time

- General Modeling Best Practices:

- More resources on modeling best practices:

### 16. Statsig secures series C funding to bring science to the art of product development

**Date:** 2025-05-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
Product development used to be an art. A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. That simply doesn’t cut it today


**Key Points:**

- Product development used to be an art.

- With this investment, we’re doubling down on our mission to help every product team embrace the science of building great products.

- Building products today can get messy. Why?

- Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.

- Large teams create misalignment:Multiple stakeholders, disjointed workflows, and scattered data lead to endless debates instead of decisive action.

**Date:** 2025-04-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact. Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics


**Key Points:**

- Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact.

- When are Release Pipelines used?

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands
For a startup shipping one feature a month, an A/B test is a neat side project. At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude


**Key Points:**

- Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands

- Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude.

- Coverage: What fraction of product change is truly tested?

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

### 20. Release pipelines: Safer, staged rollouts across your infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-04-22T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/release-pipelines


**Summary:**  
Infra teams now have an additional guardrail—alast line of defensewhen changing configs. At Statsig, we believe you can move fastwithoutbreaking things. That’s why we madefeature flagsa core tool in our platform—table stakes for modern software development


**Key Points:**

- Infra teams now have an additional guardrail—alast line of defensewhen changing configs.

- When feature flags aren't enough

- Suddenly, the other 99% of users—who haven't even seen the new feature—experience degraded performance or complete outages.

- This is where our release pipelines come in.

### 21. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them. At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Every new server-side feature meant copying and pasting evaluation logic into 10 repos, wrangling language quirks, and fighting version drift


**Key Points:**

- If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them.

- With this change, we're now seeingup to 5x evaluation speeds(!)—and that's just the cherry on top of all the code sustainability benefits.

- Figure 1:In our legacy model, every new server-side feature required duplicating evaluation logic code in all 10 server SDKs.

- Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:

- We used the following FFIs (Foreign Function Interfaces) for this Rust core project:

**Date:** 2025-04-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
If you’d told me a decade ago that software teams would someday run more experiments than marketing, I’d have assumed you were joking—or pitching a dystopian adtech startup. Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. ThinkOptimizely's founding story—testing every piece of marketing in the Obama presidential campaign


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

- Experimenting with the length of forms to mitigate user dropoffs

### 26. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another. When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Traditional per-user randomization often creates “cross-group contamination,” where one side of the marketplace in treatment interacts with another side in control


**Key Points:**

- A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another.

- Cluster-based randomization

- Switchback testing

- Phased Rollouts

- Weighted randomization (multi-armed bandits)

**Date:** 2025-03-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-flag-code-cleanup


**Summary:**  
Feature flags aren't ruining your codebase. Lack of cleanup accountability is. Feature flags are the secret sauce behind the rapid releases of major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Notion, andmany others


**Key Points:**

- Feature flags aren't ruining your codebase. Lack of cleanup accountability is.

- If you’ve ever tried coding with feature flags, there’s a good chance this thought has crossed your mind at least once:

- TL;DR—Feature flags are not the problem, but theycanlead to messy code if you don’t use them responsibly. Here’s how to avoid that.

- Everyone’s happy. Job done, right?

- Say your product team runs a promo that changes how discounts are calculated. The current logic looks like this:

**Date:** 2025-03-05T00:02-08:00  
**Author:** Lin Jia  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/kpi-traps-successful-experiments-can-fail


**Summary:**  
Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever. You set up the experiment cautiously, collected data diligently, and celebrated when it achieved statistical significance for your KPI. You're ready to claim the win in the next performance review, only to find that launching the feature doesn't bring the desired positive impact to user experience


**Key Points:**

- Congratulations, you just built one of the coolest features ever.

- The experiment failed, despite getting significant results.

- Let's examine why this happens, and how to turn "failed" experiments into future wins.

- Success on paper, but failure in practice

- One of the most common reasons for such a scenario is solving the wrong problem.

**Author:** Cynthia Xin  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/settings-page-design-2025


**Summary:**  
We recently embarked on a journey to make our Settings page even better. Over the past few years, Statsig has scaled significantly, adding multiple products and features to our platform. As a result, Settings has become overly complicated to navigate


**Key Points:**

- We recently embarked on a journey to make our Settings page even better.

- Intuitive navigation (Product first, permission level second)

- In Settings 1.0, the left-side navigation menu was essentially broken down into "project" and "organization."

- This caused some confusion, with feature gate-related settings scattered across three different tabs:

**Summary:**  
“Isn’t it just a database”. “Why do people pay for this. ”
Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions


**Key Points:**

- Feature flagging is a corner of the dev tools space particularly riddled with confusion about the function and sophistication of available solutions.

- Sure, youcoulduse just a database, but do you want it to:

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Be available on the client side but still secure?

- Evaluate in <1ms on your servers, and not slow down your clients?

### 37. Debugging sample ratio mismatch: Custom dimensions in Statsig

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment. However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Issues like website crashes when serving the control version could prevent the SDK from sending exposure events to Statsig.

- However, these tools have been limited to analyzing a preset list of dimensions, such assdk_type,browser,country, andos.

- Step 1:In your project settings, list the custom dimensions you want to analyze.

- Step 2:Navigate to the Diagnostics tab and open the Experiment Health Checks.

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/when-allocation-point-and-exposure-point-differ


**Summary:**  
During a job interview, I posed the following scenario to the candidates: A company wants to test a new variation on their website’s landing page by adding a feature at the bottom. Since this feature isn’t visible when the page loads, users in the test group might leave before scrolling down to see it. Consequently, some users may never actually be exposed to the new version of the page

**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-rollouts-examples


**Summary:**  
When I was a freshman in college, Instagram was all the rage. Instagram was becoming the primary medium for keeping tabs on friends and influencers alike—perceiving the world through their iPhone lenses, in a way. A simple scroll through an Instagram feed would inform me what my friends ate for dinner, where my ex’s family vacationed, and which Uggs Kim Kardashian wanted me to buy


**Key Points:**

- When I was a freshman in college, Instagram was all the rage.

- It was truly the platform for keeping up—until it made me fall behind.

**Summary:**  
For much of my career in data science, I had a sort of shared understanding with my colleagues that the worst part of the job is dealing with a constant deluge of questions. These questions range from the actually problematic (a stakeholder asking if you can do a drill down to find a “win” in their experiment results) to great questions that just require some mental bandwidth to answer well and randomize you from the work you were planning on doing. In my two years at Statsig, I’ve totally chang


**Key Points:**

- The stakeholders I’m usually working with at Statsig don’t work at Statsig.

- This, funnily enough, leads to a reinforcing loop; as we demonstrate a willingness to collaborate, people have more product asks. This is agoodthing.

- Introducing Product AnalyticsLearn how leading companies stay on top of every metric as they roll out features.Read more

- When I see a customer question more than once, this is a near-instant trigger for me to update documentation and reach out to the design team.

- This has been especially important as part of theStatsig Warehouse Nativeteam’s process since we’re tightly integrating with customers’ data layer!

**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ab-testing-101


**Summary:**  
Just try two things, and see which one is better…well, mostly. I first learned about the concept of A/B testing in college, when I was working for an eCommerce agency. I was a part-time intern at the ~10-person company, and one of my jobs was updating the detail pages for items sold on Amazon


**Key Points:**

- Just try two things, and see which one is better…well, mostly.

- At the time, I would’ve benefitted from a course in A/B Testing 101.

- A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of something and seeing which one drives more effective results.

- How A/B testing works in 5 steps

- Most people’s understanding of A/B testing stops there. In reality, if you’re doing A/B tests correctly, there’s a lot going on under the hood.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cumulative-impact-experimentation-wins


**Summary:**  
You don’t experiment for wins
In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:
This FOMO-engendering content has a point. Experimentation is a valuable tool for understanding what kind of changes work for your product; with that knowledge in hand, you can more reliably pick a good future direction. However, in practice—and especially in product experimentation—the real wins come from not losing


**Key Points:**

- In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:

- Chasing rainbows: The illusion of the big win

- The unpalatable truth is that these victories aren’t common, and are frequently incorrect. There are a number of contributing factors:

- A penny saved is a penny earned

- Product owners use the product differently than the typical user, which skews their intuition and causes them to design unhelpful features

### 119. Optimizing AI model temperature with Statsig&#39;s Autotune

**Date:** 2023-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-experimentation-model-temperature-autotune


**Summary:**  
When building apps using large language models, developers are presented with an interesting choice: choosing model temperature. This innocuous number can have a massive impact on model performance, as you can see below:
This is obviously exaggerated, but the question remains: How do you choose the right temperature for a given application. A higher temperature invites greater creativity and variance, but risks producing errors—so what’s the right tradeoff


**Key Points:**

- When building apps using large language models, developers are presented with an interesting choice: choosing model temperature.

- This innocuous number can have a massive impact on model performance, as you can see below:

- This is obviously exaggerated, but the question remains: How do you choose the right temperature for a given application?

### 120. Feature flag solutions: Building vs. buying

**Date:** 2023-04-02T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-vs-buy-feature-flags-gates-experiment-platform


**Summary:**  
In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig. I’ve observed some patterns and developed some standard questions that I ask these customers, which I think objectively helps them begin to understand which of the build and/or buy options is right for them. Longer term I plan to create a calculator or survey that can help people understand which option they should prioritize, but in the meantime I want to share


**Key Points:**

- In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig.

- Building an experimentation platform requires specialized engineering, data science and data engineering skills and resources.

- Have your team members built similar systems before?

- What kind of infrastructure and architecture is your team familiar with?

- After surveying your team, if the answer to this question doesn’t inspire confidence,you should consider buying, or a hybrid build and buy.

**Author:** Tore Hanssen  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-do-my-facebook-groups-look-different


**Summary:**  
By now, most people realize that when they open Facebook or Instagram on their phone, their experience is very different than the person next to them. It goes deeper than just the content that you see, and the ranking algorithms backings those — the buttons you have to click, the way a post with multiple photos shows up, or even theshade of the bluemight be different. At Statsig, we’ve been working to help any company run these same types of experiments

### 132. Using Pulse Time Series for Deeper Insights

**Date:** 2022-05-16T19:35:15.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/using-pulse-time-series-for-deeper-insights


**Summary:**  
TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment. Sometimes, a brief scan of the color coded score card is enough to validate that all metrics behave as expected, and we quickly proceed with the launch. Other times, however, a more detailed understanding is required before deciding on next steps


**Key Points:**

- TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment.

- Does my experiment have a novelty effect? Do users try out the new feature once and never again?

- Is there pre-experiment bias in this metric? Was that lift there even before we launched the feature?

- This view shows the metric impact on each calendar day without aggregating days together. It’s a good one to check if we have concerns such as:

- Does the feature have a different impact on weekends vs. weekdays?

**Summary:**  
An opinionated guide on using Holdouts
Feature Level Holdouts
Good teams move fast. They’re trying several ideas at any given time. When they find something that works, they ship it and find the next idea to try


**Key Points:**

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Engineering overhead. For each feature you ship with a holdout, you’re committing to support an if-then-else fork in your code. For a fast moving team, having to support multiple code paths makes the test and debug matrix large. Shorter holdouts help make this manageable. When your legacy code path breaks — if you don’t find and fix it swiftly, your holdout results become untrustworthy.

- Opportunity cost. When you ship features that increase revenue or retention, a large holdout means leaving those gains on the table. There’s also dissatisfaction you cause when someone sees a friend with a shiny new feature that they don’t have.

- Monitoring. Holdouts are typically analyzed in detail only at the end of the holdout period. It’s useful to check in on them at a regular cadence (e.g. monthly) to make sure there isn’t anything unexpected that may taint the holdout. A broken control variant impacting only 1% of your users can make the Holdout useless if you only detect it at the end of the holdout period. There’s little point comparing metrics between users with new features and users with a broken experience. The act of checking the performance of the Holdout group can spawn investigations to understand unexpected movements.

- Users, Customer Support & Marketing.For people in the holdout, it is confusing to see friends get a spiffy new feature, while you don’t. It’s important to retire and create new holdouts every cycle — so it’s not the same set of users punished again and again.

### 134. There’s More To Learn From Tests

**Date:** 2022-04-20T18:45:44.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts. ) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way


**Key Points:**

- The Standard: Pre-Launch Experimentation

- It’s common that when people think about testing, they mostly think about pre-launch experimentation:

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

### 137. Reading Experimentation Tea Leaves

**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/reading-experimentation-tea-leaves


**Summary:**  
Making experiment readouts trustworthy
As we talk to many customers, one thing is clear: many common beliefs for product experimentation are plain wrong. These are often theoretical, academic and outdated. They lead teams to believe in a false sense of precision and waste months waiting on a handful of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Making experiment readouts trustworthy

- With great power though comes great responsibility

- You can also useholdouts and backteststo measure the cumulative impact of features over a longer period of time.

- A few tips to make sure you’re not reacting to noise -

- Have a hypothesis on the change you’re making (and expected impact). If you’re rolling out a bug fix to the video player in the Facebook app and see a small reduction in new user signups, it’s unlikely your bug fix is causing that. But if you are seeing an increase in video watch time, then you can usually be sure your fix is working as intended. Many practitioners apply a 95% confidence interval to metrics they’re expecting impact on, and use a 99% confidence interval on other metrics.

Every feature is well intentioned but…
Every feature is well-intentioned… that’s why we build them. However, our experience is less than a third create positive impact. Another third of the features require iteration before they land the desired impact — users might not discover it or are confused by it


**Key Points:**

- Every feature is well intentioned but…

- Tavouris an app that helps fill your fridge with unique, craft beers you can’t find locally. They use Statsig to manage features and run experiments.

**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/environments-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
In the summer of 2021, HBO accidentally sent an email to millions of past and current subscribers with the body “This message is used by integration tests only”. The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments. For continuous deployment, teams often create environments for development, staging and production


**Key Points:**

- The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments.

- Two philosophies : Per Environment Config vs Global Config

- Some advantages of the Global Config approach (with environment specific exceptions) include…

- This is useful in production where stability is paramount, but can slow down iteration in development and staging environments.

### 157. My Five Favorite Things About Swift

**Date:** 2021-05-11T07:20:26.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/my-five-favorite-things-about-swift


**Summary:**  
Statsigstrives to empower all developers to ship features faster, so naturally one of the first milestones for us was to provide an SDK for iOS development. I started doing iOS development at Facebook, which only used Objective-C for its iOS apps. But given Swift’s growing popularity (Apple’s own adoption has been growing quickly), we decided to offer and write our SDK natively in Swift


**Key Points:**

- Swift is much more readable

- NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;

- NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;

- NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];

- Swift supports modern language features

**Summary:**  
RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust
RUIDs (Rodrigo’s Unique Identifiers) are 64 bit ids mathematically guaranteed to be unique when generated within the sameRUID root. Check it out on GitHub. AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration


**Key Points:**

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

- The canonical version of RUIDs (this repo) uses 41 bits for timestamp, 14 bits for a monotonically increasing sequence, and 9 bits for the root id.

- bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

### 162. Why we started Statsig

**Date:** 2021-03-17T08:33:11.000Z  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-we-started-statsig


**Summary:**  
When I joined Facebook, one of the things that surprised me was the autonomy Engineers had in building new products and features, and how this enabled them to move really fast. I was curious how decisions were made around product features, since based on my previous experience, the bulk of the time sink happened inside conference rooms — where experienced engineers and PMs debated the details, made decisions, and wrote design docs, all before the first line of code was even written. Product deve


**Key Points:**

- Product development at Facebook often started with the germ of an idea which was quickly translated into code.

- If people wrote code right away, how did they make sure they were building features users actually wanted?

- Gatekeeper:Allows developers to build features visible only to a targeted set of users. For example, these could bedogfoodersand testers until a feature is ready for public consumption. Engineers will then open it up to a small user base to validate everything is working well before launching to the world.

- And the biggest peace-of-mind comes from knowing that when something goes really wrong at any point,you can easily turn features off in real-time.

- Quick Experiments (A/B):This tool takes the debates out of conference rooms and puts hypotheses to test in production. Instead of endless discussions about the “perfect” design, the amount of flexibility to provide, the corner cases to cover, engineers quickly code up different variants and put them out in front of users. How users interact with the product gives rich insights into what works and what doesn’t.

**Date:** 2025-10-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparison-corrections-in-a-b


**Summary:**  
In the world of A/B testing, one common challenge is the issue of multiple comparisons. This occurs when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted simultaneously, whether it’s peeking at the data during the experiment, examining several key performance indicators (KPIs), or analyzing different segments of the population. In a previous blog, we explored in detail therisks of inflating false positives (alpha) in these situations


**Key Points:**

- Behind the scenes: What is the core difference between correction methods?

- Solutions for multiple comparisons

- The BH procedure works as follows:

- Rank all p-values in ascending order.

### 11. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
AI is changing how we build software. With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. As teams embed AI deeper into their products, and they're facing a new challenge


**Key Points:**

- AI is changing how we build software.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

- AI breaks this model in two critical ways:

- Today, AI products operate in open-ended domains where "correct" has infinite variations and context matters more than accuracy.

- Teams are operating without the foundation they used to rely on: the ability to rigorously test software in a non-production environment.

### 12. The more the merrier? The problem of multiple comparisons in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-07-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
The problem of multiple comparisons represents a fundamental clash between statistical inference and human intuition. After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results. The goal of this blog is to explain why our intuition leads us astray in this case and to clarify the multiple comparisons problem


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- Figure 1.Probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (alpha) as a function of the number of tests.

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it. You may choose the correct statistical method for your test, carefully plan the sample size needed to achieve adequate power, and thoroughly confirm that your assumptions are met, but none of these efforts will be worth it if your samples are not random


**Key Points:**

- Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it?

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

### 14. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools. Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift. With your current traffic, that meanseleven weeksof waiting to gather enough user data


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights. However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. This approach creates a bottleneck, delaying the launch of new experiments until the ongoing one is completed


**Key Points:**

- In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights.

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- The illustration below outlines two possible scenarios for this kind of test:

### 18. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
When we first started Statsig, we had one infra engineer and a highly manual process. Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. You know that meme: “If your infra dev got hit by a bus, would your company survive


**Key Points:**

- The answer was yes, but it took a lot of clever design decisions and tooling.

- You can think of this process in three main phases. We’ll walk through each in detail, but in a nutshell:

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

### 19. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now. When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%


**Key Points:**

- Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now.

- Introducing Fieller intervals in Statsig

- What's the difference between Fieller intervals and the Delta Method?

- How are Fieller intervals calculated?

- Determine if a Fieller interval is well-defined

**Summary:**  
The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them. After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. The challenge of proving value
When I joined Statsig as PM for our SDKs team, I faced a daunting reality: much of my engineering team had been th


**Key Points:**

- The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them.

- This fear isn't unique to me. I've seen it repeatedly in conversations with other PMs, including many of our customers.

- The natural response to this anxiety is to try to prove your worth through control.

- The two paths for product leaders

- When facing this credibility gap, product managers typically choose between two paths:

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale. Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Namely, “How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale


**Key Points:**

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- At a high-level, our solution works by replicating the user-property updates in Bigtable into a Type 2 SCD BigQuery table. Here’s how it works:

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture. When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. My metrics-focused foundation
My tech career began as a Growth Manager at Rupeek, a Series-A fintech startup in India


**Key Points:**

- The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture.

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- This revealed the true PM dilemma: It's easy to say 'focus on outcomes', but much harder to identify which outcomes matter.

- This created three key problems:

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 24. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
The distinction between “do no harm” and “do good” goals significantly impacts the type of test you choose and the likelihood of obtaining a meaningful result. Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- Here are some situations where non-inferiority testing can be particularly relevant:

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

**Key Points:**

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

- While I was confident in my product strategy, the root of the issue washow I approached execution.

- By polishing a "perfect" plan before involving senior stakeholders, I created two critical problems:

- What I should have done was ship thin slices early:releaseminimal viable productsthat tested core hypotheses andgenerated real user feedback.

- By getting something tangible in front of users and stakeholders quickly, PMs can:

### 26. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
You don’t need to wait a year to know if your feature worked—surrogate metrics let you move fastandstay anchored to long-term outcomes that actually matter. Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. If you bring the predicted values and mean squared error (MSE) of the model used to make these predictions, we’ll accurately account for the model’s prediction error when calculating p-values and confidence intervals


**Key Points:**

- Why are surrogate metrics helpful?

- Surrogate metric best practices

- Validate your predictive model and monitor over time

- General Modeling Best Practices:

- More resources on modeling best practices:

### 27. Statsig secures series C funding to bring science to the art of product development

**Date:** 2025-05-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
Product development used to be an art. A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. That simply doesn’t cut it today


**Key Points:**

- Product development used to be an art.

- With this investment, we’re doubling down on our mission to help every product team embrace the science of building great products.

- Building products today can get messy. Why?

- Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.

- Large teams create misalignment:Multiple stakeholders, disjointed workflows, and scattered data lead to endless debates instead of decisive action.

**Author:** Jason Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/continuous-promotion-for-infrastructure-with-statsig-and-pulumi


**Summary:**  
Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact. Modern teams rarely flip a single switch when rolling out a new feature. Instead, they stage changes across environments, user cohorts, or regions to steadily increase exposure while watching metrics


**Key Points:**

- Ship infrastructure changes at the same pace as your application code—safely, gradually, and with measurable impact.

- When are Release Pipelines used?

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Rollouts that need to respectinfrastructure boundaries(e.g., multi‑region / multi‑cluster)

- Progressive delivery across environments withzero‑downtime(e.g., dev → staging → prod)

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/addressing-complexity-in-enterprise-scale-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands
For a startup shipping one feature a month, an A/B test is a neat side project. At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude


**Key Points:**

- Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands

- Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude.

- Coverage: What fraction of product change is truly tested?

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

### 32. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them. At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Every new server-side feature meant copying and pasting evaluation logic into 10 repos, wrangling language quirks, and fighting version drift


**Key Points:**

- If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them.

- With this change, we're now seeingup to 5x evaluation speeds(!)—and that's just the cherry on top of all the code sustainability benefits.

- Figure 1:In our legacy model, every new server-side feature required duplicating evaluation logic code in all 10 server SDKs.

- Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:

- We used the following FFIs (Foreign Function Interfaces) for this Rust core project:

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
If you’d told me a decade ago that software teams would someday run more experiments than marketing, I’d have assumed you were joking—or pitching a dystopian adtech startup. Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. ThinkOptimizely's founding story—testing every piece of marketing in the Obama presidential campaign

### 36. The power of SEO A/B testing 

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As an outsider to the SEO world, I'd always seen it as a world of convention: add your meta descriptions, set your canonicals, write something novel, and the traffic will come. It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Certainly, all of the above (metas, canonicals, novel content) are best practices—but if they're well-known principles, can they really se


**Key Points:**

- How can the algorithm—and its many rules—allow you to AB test like you normally would?

- First, and perhaps obviously, we have to follow the rules of the algorithm.

- For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:

- On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-ab-testing-is-ultimately-qualitative


**Summary:**  
A/B testing is essential for data-driven teams, but its real value isn’t just in the metrics—it’s in the ultimately qualitative decisions that those metrics enable. Understanding the bigger picture
Real-world decision-making doesn’t happen in a statistical vacuum. People with diverse perspectives have to debate options in a room, weighing pros and cons between multiple (sometimes conflicting) objectives, many of which can't be captured in a single metric


**Key Points:**

- Understanding the bigger picture

- The limitations of data and the role of expert judgment

- A balanced approach: Numbers and narrative

- Talk to the pros, become a proWe're on standby to help you start using your data to make better decisions.Let's chat

### 44. Tracking outliers in A/B testing: When one apple spoils the barrel

**Date:** 2025-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/tracking-outliers-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As A/B testing analysts, we often encounter skewed distributions for our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), especially when dealing with revenue metrics. It’s easy to accept these distributions as they are, but the presence of outliers—extreme high or low values—can quietly disrupt the validity of our tests. These outliers can inflate variance, which in turn reduces statistical power, and lead to misleading conclusions, making it harder to detect real effects


**Key Points:**

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

- Type I error (α):The probability of incorrectly concluding that a new version is better when it actually isn’t.

### 46. Designing controlled experiments to test correlated metrics

**Date:** 2025-03-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/designing-controlled-experiments-correlated-metrics


**Summary:**  
What are correlated metrics. Correlationoccurs when there is a relationship between the values of some variable with the values of some other bariable. This is contrasted byindependence, where there is no relationship between the values of two variables


**Key Points:**

- Correlated metrics in an experiment

- In an experimental context, you might care about several different types of correlated metrics:

- These all can serve different functions in an experiment

- Note that usage of Surrogate Metrics also requires for prediction error to be accounted for in reading experimental restuls.

### 47. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another. When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Traditional per-user randomization often creates “cross-group contamination,” where one side of the marketplace in treatment interacts with another side in control


**Key Points:**

- A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another.

- Cluster-based randomization

- Switchback testing

- Phased Rollouts

- Weighted randomization (multi-armed bandits)

### 49. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. Bayesian alternatives promise more intuitive “probability of being better” metrics and flexible sequential monitoring


**Key Points:**

- Introduction

- This paper distinguishes two broad ways in which “informedness” can be brought into Bayesian A/B testing:

- Therefore, in applications, we should be careful about the misuse of Bayesian without understanding their misuse:

- Our goal is to clarify these trade-offs and suggest ways to harness Bayesian methods responsibly. For such purposes, we recommend two approaches:

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/data-driven-marketing-attribution-shortcomings


**Summary:**  
From huge enterprises to niche e-commerce brands, every marketer grapples with the same fundamental question: Where should we invest our marketing budget for the greatest return. Ideally, you’d like a tidy calculation that says, “Channel A accounts for 25% of conversions, Channel B for 40%, Channel C for 10%,” and so on. That’s the allure of marketing attribution: pinpointing exactly which touchpoints move the needle and which are mere distractions


**Key Points:**

- The problem: Evaluating marketing spend in a complex landscape

- What data-driven models promise

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

### 63. How Statsig uses query-level experiments to speed up Metrics Explorer

**Date:** 2025-02-20T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Nicole Smith  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/query-level-experiments-metrics-explorer


**Summary:**  
Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes. Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. This is a super common challenge for B2B companies: a professional user base means that behaviors are pretty static and there isn’t the same scale of users that Google or Facebook have to detect small effects


**Key Points:**

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- There are a few reasons why running an experiment can be helpful here in particular:

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

- IF we just use a CTE instead of a creating a temp table

**Date:** 2025-01-17T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Daniel West  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/custom-dimensions-sample-ratio-mismatch


**Summary:**  
For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment. However,Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)can sometimes occur in setups like this, leading to uneven splits in user groups. For instance, in an experiment targeting a 50/50 split between control and test groups, a company might expose 1,000 users


**Key Points:**

- For customers like Vista, experiments are often run using Statsig SDKs to handle assignment.

- Issues like website crashes when serving the control version could prevent the SDK from sending exposure events to Statsig.

- However, these tools have been limited to analyzing a preset list of dimensions, such assdk_type,browser,country, andos.

### 96. Feature rollouts: How Instagram left me behind

**Date:** 2024-10-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Sami Springman  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/feature-rollouts-examples


**Summary:**  
When I was a freshman in college, Instagram was all the rage. Instagram was becoming the primary medium for keeping tabs on friends and influencers alike—perceiving the world through their iPhone lenses, in a way. A simple scroll through an Instagram feed would inform me what my friends ate for dinner, where my ex’s family vacationed, and which Uggs Kim Kardashian wanted me to buy


**Key Points:**

- When I was a freshman in college, Instagram was all the rage.

- It was truly the platform for keeping up—until it made me fall behind.

- And that’s what users did. Except for me.

- I didn’t have the Stories feature.

- Eventually, I threw in the towel and emailed Instagram support, begging for the feature.

### 109. Funnels in experimentation: A perfect pair 🍐

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products. In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms


**Key Points:**

- Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products.

- Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms.

- Based on this,I was initially fairly cynical about funnels. It’s true that funnels do have some fundamental limitations:

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

Picture this: You're planning an experiment and are well-versed in concepts like Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE), significance level, statistical power, and sample size determination. You understand that failing to plan the test duration can lead to underpowered tests and inflated false positive rates due to peeking. Recently, you've been introduced toCUPED, an advanced statistical method that reduces KPI variance, resulting in more sensitive tests (lower MDE) or shorter test durations (lower sa


**Key Points:**

- If this description fits you, you’re in the right place 😊

- What is test planning and why is it important?

- What is CUPED and why is it important?

- The variance of \(\overline{Y}_{\text{CUPED}}\) is reduced by the square of the Pearson correlation between \(\overline{X}\) and \(\overline{Y}\):

- In reality, we don't know the true values of the variables, so we must estimate them.

**Author:** Cooper Reid  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/demystifying-identity-resolution


**Summary:**  
The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds. The notion of “identity resolution” in the SaaS world continues to be an elusive gold standard that businesses want to solve in order to understand the full scope of customer behaviors across all touch-points. To that end, I promise not to use the term “omnichannel” in this blog


**Key Points:**

- The customer experience often spans across identity boundaries, devices, sessions, and the digital and physical worlds.

- To that end, I promise not to use the term “omnichannel” in this blog.🙂

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-allies-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
For much of my career in data science, I had a sort of shared understanding with my colleagues that the worst part of the job is dealing with a constant deluge of questions. These questions range from the actually problematic (a stakeholder asking if you can do a drill down to find a “win” in their experiment results) to great questions that just require some mental bandwidth to answer well and randomize you from the work you were planning on doing. In my two years at Statsig, I’ve totally chang


**Key Points:**

- The stakeholders I’m usually working with at Statsig don’t work at Statsig.

- This, funnily enough, leads to a reinforcing loop; as we demonstrate a willingness to collaborate, people have more product asks. This is agoodthing.

- Introducing Product AnalyticsLearn how leading companies stay on top of every metric as they roll out features.Read more

- When I see a customer question more than once, this is a near-instant trigger for me to update documentation and reach out to the design team.

- This has been especially important as part of theStatsig Warehouse Nativeteam’s process since we’re tightly integrating with customers’ data layer!

### 207. Switchback experiments: Overview and considerations

**Date:** 2023-11-14T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/switchback-experiments


**Summary:**  
When should someone use a switchback test instead of an A/B test. Switchback experiments are a way to measure the impact of a change when network effects render traditional A/B tests impractical, as is often the case in 2-sided marketplace products. A canonical example of this scenario comes from ridesharing services likeLyft: All the riders in an area share the same supply of drivers, and vice versa


**Key Points:**

- When should someone use a switchback test instead of an A/B test?

- Since the test and control groups are not independent, a simple A/B test will produce inaccurate results.

- Questions about switchback testing?

- At the most basic level, the minimum requirement for setting up a switchback experiment is determining the time interval for switching.

- The standard t-test commonly used for traditional A/B tests is not recommended for switchback. experiments:

**Date:** 2023-10-18T00:00-04:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/sequential-testing-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Sequential testing is a solution to the “peeking problem” in A/B testing, allowing continuous monitoring of experiment results without increasing the False Positive Rate (FPR). We recently revamped Statsig’s Sequential Testing methodology to enable faster decisions. Compared to our previous implementation, this new approach has higher statistical power during the early days of the experiment while enforcing a strict cap on FPR


**Key Points:**

- The need for sequential testing

- Limitations of the underlying statistical test

- Statsig’s sequential testing methodology

- The false positive rate in A/A tests remains below 5% even with repeated measurements over a 4-week period.

**Summary:**  
I’m not really a “manual labor” guy…
Not to say I won’t rake some leaves, build a desk, orsplice buttons onto my PS5 controller. I’m talking aboutcopying and pasting, rephrasing, categorizing, and other tedious, manual tasks. There’s a tired old trope about howAI is not good enough to "replace people


**Key Points:**

- I’m not really a “manual labor” guy…

- AI assists me with the manual labor I so dread—the tasks that make me feel less like a marketer and more likean LLMmyself.

- Statsig is full of help. Ourwebsite documentationis comprehensive and includeswalkthroughs and guideson tons of relevant topics:

- But in terms of prioritization,writing a glossary would take weeks, and there are much better things to spend that time on…

**Key Points:**

- Semantic layers act as a bridge between raw data and business users, translating complex data structures into understandable and usable commodities.

- As with most best practices, the power of a semantic layer is amplified when used in conjunction with Statsig.

- A promising solution to this issue is the introduction of a semantic layer.

- The semantic layer serves as a centralized translator, bridging the gap between the data storage and the data consumers.

- Typically, a semantic layer is a repository of static YAML/SQL files that represent a semantic graph that can be used to query metrics.

"Let’s use a coin toss to decide—first to 50 wins. "
Imagine we’re flipping a fair coin several times and get 8 heads and 2 tails. (A fair coin is a balanced one, and has never been used in a magician’s routine


**Key Points:**

- Sample ratio mismatch is evidence of selection bias

- Points to an implementation issue

- This won’t happen if you’re using Statsig because our SDK filters out ineligible users evenly across all experiment groups

- Data processing issues:there may be some process by which this data is being deleted or duplicated for only the control or test variant.

- If you’re sending all your data through Statsig, we do the data processing and there shouldn’t be SRM coming from data processing

**Date:** 2023-06-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cumulative-impact-experimentation-wins


**Summary:**  
You don’t experiment for wins
In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:
This FOMO-engendering content has a point. Experimentation is a valuable tool for understanding what kind of changes work for your product; with that knowledge in hand, you can more reliably pick a good future direction. However, in practice—and especially in product experimentation—the real wins come from not losing


**Key Points:**

- In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:

- Chasing rainbows: The illusion of the big win

- The unpalatable truth is that these victories aren’t common, and are frequently incorrect. There are a number of contributing factors:

- A penny saved is a penny earned

- Product owners use the product differently than the typical user, which skews their intuition and causes them to design unhelpful features

### 245. CUPED on Statsig

**Date:** 2022-07-07T21:55:42.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/cuped-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Run experiments with more speed and accuracy
We’re pleased to announce the rollout of CUPED for all our customers. Statsig will now automatically use CUPED to reduce variance and bias on experiments’ key metrics. This gives you access to a powerful experiment tool being used at top tech companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Airbnb and more


**Key Points:**

- Run experiments with more speed and accuracy

- Now the results will reflect the reality that this experiment drove an increase for users in the test group!

- We’ll be monitoring this as it rolls out to understand how effective this is and if there’s any next steps we can take to level up our approach.

- Sample Size / Variance Reduction

- The effectiveness of CUPED varies across user populations and metrics. It’s worth knowing what to look for!

**Summary:**  
Training your team to make independent decisions
“It was like the debate of a group of savages as to how to extract a screw from a piece of wood. Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear


**Key Points:**

- Training your team to make independent decisions

- People who are right a lot, they listen a lot, and people who are right a lot, change their mind a lot.

- People who are right seek to dis-confirm their most profoundly-held convictions, which is very unnatural for humans.

- Jeff Bezos

- I wish more folks shared how they train their teams and operationalize independent decision making. Here’s my short list.

### 249. Using Pulse Time Series for Deeper Insights

**Date:** 2022-05-16T19:35:15.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/using-pulse-time-series-for-deeper-insights


**Summary:**  
TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment. Sometimes, a brief scan of the color coded score card is enough to validate that all metrics behave as expected, and we quickly proceed with the launch. Other times, however, a more detailed understanding is required before deciding on next steps


**Key Points:**

- TheStatsig Pulseresults page offers a snapshot of all the metric movements driven by an experiment.

- Does my experiment have a novelty effect? Do users try out the new feature once and never again?

- Is there pre-experiment bias in this metric? Was that lift there even before we launched the feature?

- This view shows the metric impact on each calendar day without aggregating days together. It’s a good one to check if we have concerns such as:

- Does the feature have a different impact on weekends vs. weekdays?

**Summary:**  
A Bayesian exploration of road rage methodology, and its important applications to experimentation
Disclaimer: this is in good fun and I don’t advocate road rage. You, dear reader, are driving somewhere nice. However, the driver behind you is determined to make you have a bad day; they’ve come up uncomfortably close behind you and you’re pretty sure they’re a bad driver who should feel bad about how they’re driving


**Key Points:**

- A Bayesian exploration of road rage methodology, and its important applications to experimentation

- Disclaimer: this is in good fun and I don’t advocate road rage.

- Soon, they pass you, and the age-old question rings through your brain:

- Do I need to let this person know that they’re a jerk?

- The decision above is of course a personal one, but it does have some interesting inputs.

### 251. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
An opinionated guide on using Holdouts
Feature Level Holdouts
Good teams move fast. They’re trying several ideas at any given time. When they find something that works, they ship it and find the next idea to try


**Key Points:**

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Engineering overhead. For each feature you ship with a holdout, you’re committing to support an if-then-else fork in your code. For a fast moving team, having to support multiple code paths makes the test and debug matrix large. Shorter holdouts help make this manageable. When your legacy code path breaks — if you don’t find and fix it swiftly, your holdout results become untrustworthy.

- Opportunity cost. When you ship features that increase revenue or retention, a large holdout means leaving those gains on the table. There’s also dissatisfaction you cause when someone sees a friend with a shiny new feature that they don’t have.

- Monitoring. Holdouts are typically analyzed in detail only at the end of the holdout period. It’s useful to check in on them at a regular cadence (e.g. monthly) to make sure there isn’t anything unexpected that may taint the holdout. A broken control variant impacting only 1% of your users can make the Holdout useless if you only detect it at the end of the holdout period. There’s little point comparing metrics between users with new features and users with a broken experience. The act of checking the performance of the Holdout group can spawn investigations to understand unexpected movements.

- Users, Customer Support & Marketing.For people in the holdout, it is confusing to see friends get a spiffy new feature, while you don’t. It’s important to retire and create new holdouts every cycle — so it’s not the same set of users punished again and again.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts. ) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way


**Key Points:**

- The Standard: Pre-Launch Experimentation

- It’s common that when people think about testing, they mostly think about pre-launch experimentation:

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

**Summary:**  
The tools that make our jobs possible
When my co-workerSami Springmanand I joined Statsig, we both came from Snowflake- a mature sales organization with every bizdev tool you could dream of. As the first sales people at Statsig, we’ve been building our biztech stack from zero. After some trial and error, we have a list of 4 tools wecan’t live without


**Key Points:**

- The tools that make our jobs possible

- To be totally candid, without Sales Navigator, my job would benext-to-impossible.

- Most of the outbound business we source is either directly through LinkedIn, or from Zoominfo phone numbers/ emails.

- The only caveat for Outreach- the tool is less useful for account execs who aren’t making many cold calls + bulk emails.

- For younger orgs without published contact info, Seamless has been very helpful.

### 261. Reading Experimentation Tea Leaves

**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/reading-experimentation-tea-leaves


**Summary:**  
Making experiment readouts trustworthy
As we talk to many customers, one thing is clear: many common beliefs for product experimentation are plain wrong. These are often theoretical, academic and outdated. They lead teams to believe in a false sense of precision and waste months waiting on a handful of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Making experiment readouts trustworthy

- With great power though comes great responsibility

- You can also useholdouts and backteststo measure the cumulative impact of features over a longer period of time.

- A few tips to make sure you’re not reacting to noise -

- Have a hypothesis on the change you’re making (and expected impact). If you’re rolling out a bug fix to the video player in the Facebook app and see a small reduction in new user signups, it’s unlikely your bug fix is causing that. But if you are seeing an increase in video watch time, then you can usually be sure your fix is working as intended. Many practitioners apply a 95% confidence interval to metrics they’re expecting impact on, and use a 99% confidence interval on other metrics.

More than Blue Button vs Green Button: How we use Statsig
Statsig is a feature flagging and experimentation platform, and the most frequent response to this is “what do you mean by experimentation platform. ” The easiest way to explain it: Statsig helps you run A/B tests to optimize your product. When people hear this, they often jump to “Oh, so green button vs blue button, right


**Key Points:**

- More than Blue Button vs Green Button: How we use Statsig

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/failing-fast-kiss-a-lot-of-frogs


**Summary:**  
Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast. In a startup, everybody builds stuff (code, websites, sales lists, etc) — and part of the building process is accepting that not everything you make is good. But, switching from outcome to learning-oriented can speed up productivity, and make it easier to identify good ideas


**Key Points:**

- Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast.

- But, this is when I learned the value of minimum viable products (MVPs).

Every feature is well-intentioned… that’s why we build them. However, our experience is less than a third create positive impact. Another third of the features require iteration before they land the desired impact — users might not discover it or are confused by it


**Key Points:**

- Every feature is well intentioned but…

- Tavouris an app that helps fill your fridge with unique, craft beers you can’t find locally. They use Statsig to manage features and run experiments.

- Tavour decided to tweak the feature to let users see more auto complete suggestions without having to scroll.

- The revised feature increased new user activation rate, giving them the confidence to finish rolling out this feature!

**Summary:**  
I worked on Facebook News Feed before I joined Statsig, and that’s where I learned about the value of experimentation. The culture in News Feed wasn’t just to use experiments to verify that our intuitions about what changes may lead to improvements were true. We also used experiments much like any good scientist would to understand more about their field—we started with a question, formed a hypothesis, and then went about constructing an experiment that would allow us to test our hypothesis and 


**Key Points:**

- I worked on Facebook News Feed before I joined Statsig, and that’s where I learned about the value of experimentation.

- Here’s an example of this method in action.

**Summary:**  
In the summer of 2021, HBO accidentally sent an email to millions of past and current subscribers with the body “This message is used by integration tests only”. The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments. For continuous deployment, teams often create environments for development, staging and production


**Key Points:**

- The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments.

- Two philosophies : Per Environment Config vs Global Config

- Some advantages of the Global Config approach (with environment specific exceptions) include…

- This is useful in production where stability is paramount, but can slow down iteration in development and staging environments.

**Date:** 2021-10-22T05:10:07.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence. An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in. Specifically, we design any SDK for either client-side or server-side applications


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

- Curious what the differences are? Read on!

- Serves a single user at a time

### 278. Sales development hacks

**Date:** 2021-10-20T02:14:39.000Z  
**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
Sales is all about process. I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel


**Key Points:**

- Nail your pitch

- I pitch to my mom. If she doesn’t understand it, I still have work to do.

- For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”

- Don’t reinvent the wheel

- Spend the 10 minutes to build out a great email, save it, andmake sure you never write that email again.

### 279. User-Level vs. Device-Level Experiments with Statsig

**Date:** 2021-10-15T03:47:36.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/user-level-vs-device-level-experiments


**Summary:**  
A common challenge in A/B testing arises when we want to track customers from logged-out to logged-in states. Consider, for example, testing a new variant of the account creation flow. This begins with logged-out customers, but we also want to monitor key metrics and events once they complete the flow and log in


**Key Points:**

- Comparing key metrics across test and control groups requires joining 2 different sets of logs: Exposures and events.

- Exposures:Every time we run a check to determine which experience is delivered to a user (e.g.: test or control), we create a log containing:

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Group: The experiment group they were placed in

**Summary:**  
RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust
RUIDs (Rodrigo’s Unique Identifiers) are 64 bit ids mathematically guaranteed to be unique when generated within the sameRUID root. Check it out on GitHub. AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration


**Key Points:**

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

- The canonical version of RUIDs (this repo) uses 41 bits for timestamp, 14 bits for a monotonically increasing sequence, and 9 bits for the root id.

- bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups
As companies become more comfortable with running AB tests, they often consider simultaneously testing more than one variation. It’s called a multi-arm experiment, also known as multi-group and A/B/n (ABn) testing (but should not be confused withmulti-armed bandit experiments, hopefully the topic of a later blog post). Multi-arm testing involves two or more test groups (eg


**Key Points:**

- Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups

- Significance is Much More Significant

- Solution #1: Apply a Bonferroni correction

- The Bonferroni correction is risk-adverse solution that errs on avoiding Type I errors at the expense of Type II errors.

**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-we-started-statsig


**Summary:**  
When I joined Facebook, one of the things that surprised me was the autonomy Engineers had in building new products and features, and how this enabled them to move really fast. I was curious how decisions were made around product features, since based on my previous experience, the bulk of the time sink happened inside conference rooms — where experienced engineers and PMs debated the details, made decisions, and wrote design docs, all before the first line of code was even written. Product deve


**Key Points:**

- Product development at Facebook often started with the germ of an idea which was quickly translated into code.

- If people wrote code right away, how did they make sure they were building features users actually wanted?

- Gatekeeper:Allows developers to build features visible only to a targeted set of users. For example, these could bedogfoodersand testers until a feature is ready for public consumption. Engineers will then open it up to a small user base to validate everything is working well before launching to the world.

- And the biggest peace-of-mind comes from knowing that when something goes really wrong at any point,you can easily turn features off in real-time.

- Quick Experiments (A/B):This tool takes the debates out of conference rooms and puts hypotheses to test in production. Instead of endless discussions about the “perfect” design, the amount of flexibility to provide, the corner cases to cover, engineers quickly code up different variants and put them out in front of users. How users interact with the product gives rich insights into what works and what doesn’t.

### 1. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong: Navigating multiple comparison corrections in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-23T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparison-corrections-in-a-b


**Summary:**  
In the world of A/B testing, one common challenge is the issue of multiple comparisons. This occurs when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted simultaneously, whether it’s peeking at the data during the experiment, examining several key performance indicators (KPIs), or analyzing different segments of the population. In a previous blog, we explored in detail therisks of inflating false positives (alpha) in these situations


**Key Points:**

- Behind the scenes: What is the core difference between correction methods?

- Solutions for multiple comparisons

- The BH procedure works as follows:

- Rank all p-values in ascending order.

### 10. Your users are your best benchmark: a guide to testing and optimizing AI products

**Date:** 2025-07-09T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/guide-to-testing-optimizing-ai


**Summary:**  
AI is changing how we build software. With AI startups capturingover half of venture capital dollarsand most products adding generative features, we're entering what the World Economic Forum calls the"cognitive era"- where AI goes from powering simple tools to acting as the foundation of autonomous systems. As teams embed AI deeper into their products, and they're facing a new challenge


**Key Points:**

- AI is changing how we build software.

- The two fundamental problems with AI development

- AI breaks this model in two critical ways:

- Today, AI products operate in open-ended domains where "correct" has infinite variations and context matters more than accuracy.

- Teams are operating without the foundation they used to rely on: the ability to rigorously test software in a non-production environment.

### 11. The more the merrier? The problem of multiple comparisons in A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-07-08T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/multiple-comparisons-in-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
The problem of multiple comparisons represents a fundamental clash between statistical inference and human intuition. After all, how can simply looking at the data multiple times or analyzing several key performance indicators (KPIs) alter the pattern of results. The goal of this blog is to explain why our intuition leads us astray in this case and to clarify the multiple comparisons problem


**Key Points:**

- The problem: The risk of false positives

- Figure 1.Probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (alpha) as a function of the number of tests.

- When multiple comparisons problems arise

- Now that we understand why multiple comparisons are problematic, let’s look at some common scenarios in A/B testing where this issue often arises:

### 12. Randomization: The ABC’s of A/B Testing

**Date:** 2025-06-30T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/randomization-the-abcs-of-a-b-testing


**Summary:**  
Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it. You may choose the correct statistical method for your test, carefully plan the sample size needed to achieve adequate power, and thoroughly confirm that your assumptions are met, but none of these efforts will be worth it if your samples are not random


**Key Points:**

- Randomization is one of the cornerstones of A/B testing. But why is randomization so important, and how can we achieve it?

- Why is randomization important?

- How can we achieve a randomized sample?

- Platforms like Statsig havebuilt-in featuresand tools that help you configure your randomization techniques according to your experimentation needs.

### 13. Speeding up A/B tests with discipline

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/speeding-up-a-b-tests-with-discipline


**Summary:**  
A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools. Imagine this: you’ve planned the perfect A/B test for checkout conversion improvements, but based on your current traffic, you’ll need at least 400k transactions in each cell to spot a 1% lift. With your current traffic, that meanseleven weeksof waiting to gather enough user data


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing can feel like marathons rather than speedruns if you’re not equipped with the right tools.

- Run tests concurrently by default

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- It sitsup-funnelfrom the target outcome.

- Historical data shows astable correlationwith the downstream KPI.

### 14. You can have it all: Parallel testing with A/B tests

**Date:** 2025-06-24T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/parallel-testing-with-a-b-tests


**Summary:**  
In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights. However, many struggle to keep up with these demands, especially in companies that operate under the constraint that only one A/B test can run at a time for a given aspect of the product. This approach creates a bottleneck, delaying the launch of new experiments until the ongoing one is completed


**Key Points:**

- In today's fast-paced industry, analysts are under constant pressure to run rapid experiments and deliver quick insights.

- How can you test in parallel effectively?

- The illustration below outlines two possible scenarios for this kind of test:

**Author:** Israel Ben Baruch  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/move-forward-the-a-b-testing-mindset-guide


**Summary:**  
A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset. The world of A/B testing is brutal. Everything is exposed, and the stats speak for themselves: You'll fail, most of the time


**Key Points:**

- A robust testing platform is a must, but you will not get far without the right mindset.

- What you should do: Practical testing principles

- What you should be: The testing mindset

- These mindset principles are what I believe separate the best A/B testers from the rest.

- What you should have: Organizational support & tools

**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-and-ai-trend


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built. We see first-hand how our customers rely on experimentation to improve their AI applications — not only OpenAI and other leading foundation model providers, but also world-class product teams building AI apps like Figma, Notion, Grammarly, Atlassian, Brex, and others. It’s not an exaggeration to say thatevery leading AI application relies on systematic A/B testingto test, launch, and optimize their prod


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we’re lucky to have a front-row seat to how the best AI products are being built.

- It’s not an exaggeration to say thatevery leading AI application relies on systematic A/B testingto test, launch, and optimize their product.

- Now, as AI takes on more of the “build” in the build > measure > learn loop,measurement, optimization, and iteration become even more critical.

- We've noticed some particularly interesting trends in how traditional experimentation is evolving to support AI development.

- Trend 1: Offline testing is being replaced by evals

### 17. From SEVs to self-serve: How we GitOps’d our infra with Pulumi &amp; Argo CD

**Date:** 2025-06-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Tyrone Wong  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/scaling-infra-with-pulumi-argocd


**Summary:**  
When we first started Statsig, we had one infra engineer and a highly manual process. Before we knew it, we were onboarding customers like OpenAI and Figma, and our stack just couldn't keep up. You know that meme: “If your infra dev got hit by a bus, would your company survive


**Key Points:**

- The answer was yes, but it took a lot of clever design decisions and tooling.

- You can think of this process in three main phases. We’ll walk through each in detail, but in a nutshell:

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Cloud provisioning phase.CI triggerspulumi upin our OPS Repo, and Pulumi provisions or updates infrastructure.

- Service deployment phase.Pulumi auto-generates our service configurations (YAML files) and Argo CD rolls out those manifests.

### 18. Calculate exact relative metric deltas with Fieller intervals

**Date:** 2025-06-10T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fieller-intervals-vs-delta-method


**Summary:**  
Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now. When you're interpreting experimental results, it’s often more intuitive to look atrelativechanges rather than absolute ones. For example, instead of saying, "This experiment improved page load latency by 100 ms," it's often more helpful to compare this change to the baseline and say something like, "This experiment decreased page load latency by 15%


**Key Points:**

- Fieller's method calculates relative metric deltas more accurately than the Delta Method, and they're available as a feature in Statsig now.

- Introducing Fieller intervals in Statsig

- What's the difference between Fieller intervals and the Delta Method?

- How are Fieller intervals calculated?

- Determine if a Fieller interval is well-defined

**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/empowering-your-team-is-the-future-of-product-leadership


**Summary:**  
The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them. After transitioning from consulting to strategy and finally to product management at Statsig, I’ve had to learn that my value as a PM isn’t proven through my own actions - it’s through the collective impact of my team. The challenge of proving value
When I joined Statsig as PM for our SDKs team, I faced a daunting reality: much of my engineering team had been th


**Key Points:**

- The most effective product leaders don’t control every decision, they create the conditions for great decisions to happen without them.

- This fear isn't unique to me. I've seen it repeatedly in conversations with other PMs, including many of our customers.

- The natural response to this anxiety is to try to prove your worth through control.

- The two paths for product leaders

- When facing this credibility gap, product managers typically choose between two paths:

**Author:** Pablo Beltran  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/simulating-bigtable-in-bigquery


**Summary:**  
How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale. Recently, our team hit a technical wall when we set out to build a new feature that enables customers to write, persist, and query user-level properties on our servers. Namely, “How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale


**Key Points:**

- How do you handle high-throughput, schema-less updatesandmake that same data queryable at scale?

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- Customers need to be able to do whole table,large analytical querieson this user-level data, such as for building user metric dashboards.

- At a high-level, our solution works by replicating the user-property updates in Bigtable into a Type 2 SCD BigQuery table. Here’s how it works:

- We have Bigtable set up with CDC enabled (in pink). This is what we use to track and replicate changes made to user properties in Bigtable.

### 22. Chasing metrics, not tasks: Why outcome-obsessed PMs win

**Date:** 2025-05-22T00:02-07:00  
**Author:** Shubham Singhal  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/chasing-metrics-not-tasks-why-outcome-obsessed-pms-win


**Summary:**  
The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture. When I transitioned from growth team at a startup to product management, I learned that one of the most valuable skills for a PM isn’t perfect planning, it’s relentless focus on outcomes over outputs. My metrics-focused foundation
My tech career began as a Growth Manager at Rupeek, a Series-A fintech startup in India


**Key Points:**

- The most impactful product managers aren’t the ones who check every box—they’re the ones who never lose sight of the bigger picture.

- The B2B challenge: When outcomes are harder to measure

- This revealed the true PM dilemma: It's easy to say 'focus on outcomes', but much harder to identify which outcomes matter.

- This created three key problems:

- Abandoning the safety of roadmaps

### 23. When being &#34;good enough&#34; is enough: Understanding non-inferiority tests

**Date:** 2025-05-21T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Allon Korem  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/understanding-non-inferiority-tests


**Summary:**  
The distinction between “do no harm” and “do good” goals significantly impacts the type of test you choose and the likelihood of obtaining a meaningful result. Primum non nocere, "First, do no harm", is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine. In A/B testing, the bar is typically set higher, with companies striving not just to avoid harm but to drive improvements


**Key Points:**

- What is a non-inferiority test?

- When do you use a non-inferiority test?

- Here are some situations where non-inferiority testing can be particularly relevant:

- How do you design a non-inferiority test?

- After setting the margin (Δ) it is time to formulate the hypotheses for a right-tail test:

**Author:** Kaz Haruna  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/fail-faster-learn-faster-why-done-beats-perfect-in-modern-product-management


**Summary:**  
Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management. After spending ten years at Uber, transitioning from operations to data science and finally to product management, I've learned that my most valuable PM skill isn't perfect decision-making, it's knowing when to ship an imperfect product. The pressure to get it perfect
As a data scientist at Uber, I enjoyed the process of building a deep understanding of the products I worked on: analyzing data, presenting insights and making r


**Key Points:**

- Perfection is the enemy of progress—especially in product management.

- While I was confident in my product strategy, the root of the issue washow I approached execution.

- By polishing a "perfect" plan before involving senior stakeholders, I created two critical problems:

- What I should have done was ship thin slices early:releaseminimal viable productsthat tested core hypotheses andgenerated real user feedback.

- By getting something tangible in front of users and stakeholders quickly, PMs can:

### 25. Introducing surrogate metrics

**Date:** 2025-05-12T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/introducing-surrogate-metrics


**Summary:**  
You don’t need to wait a year to know if your feature worked—surrogate metrics let you move fastandstay anchored to long-term outcomes that actually matter. Statsig now supports the use of surrogate metrics in experiments. If you bring the predicted values and mean squared error (MSE) of the model used to make these predictions, we’ll accurately account for the model’s prediction error when calculating p-values and confidence intervals


**Key Points:**

- Why are surrogate metrics helpful?

- Surrogate metric best practices

- Validate your predictive model and monitor over time

- General Modeling Best Practices:

- More resources on modeling best practices:

### 26. Statsig secures series C funding to bring science to the art of product development

**Date:** 2025-05-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-series-c


**Summary:**  
Product development used to be an art. A single visionary engineer or product manager would dig into a space, identify a problem, and work relentlessly to solve it—using their intuition to guide every change. That simply doesn’t cut it today


**Key Points:**

- Product development used to be an art.

- With this investment, we’re doubling down on our mission to help every product team embrace the science of building great products.

- Building products today can get messy. Why?

- Product complexity slows shipping:More features mean more dependencies, which increases testing needs and friction.

- Large teams create misalignment:Multiple stakeholders, disjointed workflows, and scattered data lead to endless debates instead of decisive action.

For a startup shipping one feature a month, an A/B test is a neat side project. At a global enterprise shipping dozens of variations every day, experimentation becomes an operating system: decisions, incentives, and even architecture tilt around it. Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude


**Key Points:**

- Rethinking coverage, metrics, and hypotheses when tests run in the thousands

- Complexity creeps in—not because the math gets harder, but because the human and organizational surface area expands by orders of magnitude.

- Coverage: What fraction of product change is truly tested?

- Why enterprises struggle:parallel roadmaps, legacy code paths, and outward pressure for quarterly results incentivize “just launch it.”

### 32. Escaping SDK maintenance hell with a core Rust engine

**Date:** 2025-04-19T00:01-07:00  
**Author:** Jina Yoon  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/escaping-sdk-maintenance-hell


**Summary:**  
If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them. At Statsig, we have over 24 SDKs our customers use to log events and run experiments—and a team of just 7 devs to maintain them. Every new server-side feature meant copying and pasting evaluation logic into 10 repos, wrangling language quirks, and fighting version drift


**Key Points:**

- If you’ve ever worked on an integrated product that publishes multiple SDKs, you know how much work it takes to update and maintain them.

- With this change, we're now seeingup to 5x evaluation speeds(!)—and that's just the cherry on top of all the code sustainability benefits.

- Figure 1:In our legacy model, every new server-side feature required duplicating evaluation logic code in all 10 server SDKs.

- Here’s a comparison of our legacy Node versus our new Node Core SDKs doing a Feature Gate check, for example:

- We used the following FFIs (Foreign Function Interfaces) for this Rust core project:

**Author:** Jack Virag  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-rise-of-experimentation


**Summary:**  
If you’d told me a decade ago that software teams would someday run more experiments than marketing, I’d have assumed you were joking—or pitching a dystopian adtech startup. Back in 2012, testing lived in landing pages and subject lines. ThinkOptimizely's founding story—testing every piece of marketing in the Obama presidential campaign


**Key Points:**

- A/B testing landing page copy and shipping the winning variant sitewide

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketing-attribution-models-tech-survey


**Summary:**  
Author's Note: You will notice a lot of formulas in this article. Having formulas doesn't necessarily make the model scientific or applicable. This survey summarizes these models as objectively as I could, but I'm going to publish other articles with my opinions


**Key Points:**

- Author's Note: You will notice a lot of formulas in this article.

- Brief history of marketing attribution in digital channels

**Date:** 2025-04-14T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Brock Lumbard  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/the-power-of-seo-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
As an outsider to the SEO world, I'd always seen it as a world of convention: add your meta descriptions, set your canonicals, write something novel, and the traffic will come. It's always tempting to accept simplifying explanations of how any system works, but running SEO that way goes against a fundamental value at Statsig:Don't mistake motion for progress. Certainly, all of the above (metas, canonicals, novel content) are best practices—but if they're well-known principles, can they really se


**Key Points:**

- How can the algorithm—and its many rules—allow you to AB test like you normally would?

- First, and perhaps obviously, we have to follow the rules of the algorithm.

- For example, you have hundreds of blogs, and you'd like to run an experiment on them:

- On the surface, this solution corrects for all of the problems we illustrated above, but it also comes with its own issues we should be mindful of.

- Page title changes,e.g. removing your company branding from product detail page titles.

**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-ab-testing-is-ultimately-qualitative


**Summary:**  
A/B testing is essential for data-driven teams, but its real value isn’t just in the metrics—it’s in the ultimately qualitative decisions that those metrics enable. Understanding the bigger picture

### 44. Designing controlled experiments to test correlated metrics

**Date:** 2025-03-28T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Liz Obermaier  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/designing-controlled-experiments-correlated-metrics


**Summary:**  
What are correlated metrics. Correlationoccurs when there is a relationship between the values of some variable with the values of some other bariable. This is contrasted byindependence, where there is no relationship between the values of two variables


**Key Points:**

- Correlated metrics in an experiment

- In an experimental context, you might care about several different types of correlated metrics:

- These all can serve different functions in an experiment

- Note that usage of Surrogate Metrics also requires for prediction error to be accounted for in reading experimental restuls.

### 45. Marketplace challenges in A/B testing and how to address them

**Date:** 2025-03-26T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/marketplace-challenges-in-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another. When you test a new feature, you can’t ignore how these groups overlap or how supply and demand might shift in unexpected ways. Traditional per-user randomization often creates “cross-group contamination,” where one side of the marketplace in treatment interacts with another side in control


**Key Points:**

- A/B tests in marketplaces can be tricky because different groups—buyers, sellers, and the platform itself—constantly affect one another.

- Cluster-based randomization

- Switchback testing

- Phased Rollouts

- Weighted randomization (multi-armed bandits)

### 47. Informed bayesian A/B testing: Two approaches

**Date:** 2025-03-13T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/informed-bayesian-ab-testing


**Summary:**  
Introduction
Traditional frequentist approaches, particularly null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), dominate A/B testing but come with well-known challenges such as “peeking” at interim data, misinterpretation of p-values, and difficulties handling multiple comparisons. Bayesian alternatives promise more intuitive “probability of being better” metrics and flexible sequential monitoring


**Key Points:**

- Introduction

- This paper distinguishes two broad ways in which “informedness” can be brought into Bayesian A/B testing:

- Therefore, in applications, we should be careful about the misuse of Bayesian without understanding their misuse:

- Our goal is to clarify these trade-offs and suggest ways to harness Bayesian methods responsibly. For such purposes, we recommend two approaches:

- Tom Cunningham’s approachof reporting the raw estimates, benchmark statistics, and idiosyncratic details.

### 50. Why data-driven marketing attribution models don&#39;t work as promised

**Date:** 2025-03-11T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Yuzheng Sun, PhD  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/data-driven-marketing-attribution-shortcomings


**Summary:**  
From huge enterprises to niche e-commerce brands, every marketer grapples with the same fundamental question: Where should we invest our marketing budget for the greatest return. Ideally, you’d like a tidy calculation that says, “Channel A accounts for 25% of conversions, Channel B for 40%, Channel C for 10%,” and so on. That’s the allure of marketing attribution: pinpointing exactly which touchpoints move the needle and which are mere distractions


**Key Points:**

- The problem: Evaluating marketing spend in a complex landscape

- What data-driven models promise

- Holistic Multi-TouchRather than attributing everything to the first or last click, these models look across the entire user journey.

**Summary:**  
Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes. Think fully redesigning the signup flow or completely changing the look and feel of the left nav bar. This is a super common challenge for B2B companies: a professional user base means that behaviors are pretty static and there isn’t the same scale of users that Google or Facebook have to detect small effects


**Key Points:**

- Historically, Statsig has focused its experiments on major changes.

- Have we triedbeing better at writing queries?

- There are a few reasons why running an experiment can be helpful here in particular:

- Running a query-level experiment in practice

- IF we just use a CTE instead of a creating a temp table

**Date:** 2024-09-18T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/funnels-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products. In most analytics platforms, funnels are a table-stakes feature and can offer rich insight into how a product’s users behave and where people drop off in their usage. Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms


**Key Points:**

- Funnel metrics are a common and powerful tool to track sequences of actions people take through tools and products.

- Unfortunately, funnels haven’t been heavily used or invested inby experimentation platforms.

- Based on this,I was initially fairly cynical about funnels. It’s true that funnels do have some fundamental limitations:

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

- A funnel rate in the context of an experiment can be tricky (or impossible) to extrapolate out to "topline impact" after launch.

**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/bayesian-experiments-beginners-guide


**Summary:**  
Where frequentist statistics assigns probabilities to data, Bayesian assigns probabilities to hypotheses. Traditionally, A/B testing has been dominated by Frequentist statistics, which rely on p-values and confidence intervals to make decisions. However, there's another approach that's gaining traction for its intuitive nature and ease of interpretation:Bayesian experiments


**Key Points:**

- Where frequentist statistics assigns probabilities to data, Bayesian assigns probabilities to hypotheses.

- Bayesian A/B testing leverages a different statistical framework, one that incorporates prior knowledge and updates beliefs with new data.

- Why experimenters sometimes opt for Bayesian experiments

**Summary:**  
When you’re buying a product analytics platform, it’s hard to know if you’re getting good value. Pricing for analytics is rarely transparent. Different vendors have different definitions of events


**Key Points:**

- When you’re buying a product analytics platform, it’s hard to know if you’re getting good value.

- Pricing for analytics is rarely transparent.

- In this post, we’ll share what we learned. Hopefully this gives you a clear sense of how to compare pricing across vendors.

- For some platforms, it was easy to calculate price at a given level of monthly events.

- Mixpanel, Posthog, and Statsig all set prices based on “analytics events” and charge a set rate per analytics event above a certain threshold.

**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/building-allies-in-experimentation


**Summary:**  
For much of my career in data science, I had a sort of shared understanding with my colleagues that the worst part of the job is dealing with a constant deluge of questions. These questions range from the actually problematic (a stakeholder asking if you can do a drill down to find a “win” in their experiment results) to great questions that just require some mental bandwidth to answer well and randomize you from the work you were planning on doing. In my two years at Statsig, I’ve totally chang


**Key Points:**

- The stakeholders I’m usually working with at Statsig don’t work at Statsig.

- This, funnily enough, leads to a reinforcing loop; as we demonstrate a willingness to collaborate, people have more product asks. This is agoodthing.

- Introducing Product AnalyticsLearn how leading companies stay on top of every metric as they roll out features.Read more

- When I see a customer question more than once, this is a near-instant trigger for me to update documentation and reach out to the design team.

- This has been especially important as part of theStatsig Warehouse Nativeteam’s process since we’re tightly integrating with customers’ data layer!

### 198. Switchback experiments: Overview and considerations

**Date:** 2023-11-14T00:00-08:00  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/switchback-experiments


**Summary:**  
When should someone use a switchback test instead of an A/B test. Switchback experiments are a way to measure the impact of a change when network effects render traditional A/B tests impractical, as is often the case in 2-sided marketplace products. A canonical example of this scenario comes from ridesharing services likeLyft: All the riders in an area share the same supply of drivers, and vice versa


**Key Points:**

- When should someone use a switchback test instead of an A/B test?

- Since the test and control groups are not independent, a simple A/B test will produce inaccurate results.

- Questions about switchback testing?

- At the most basic level, the minimum requirement for setting up a switchback experiment is determining the time interval for switching.

- The standard t-test commonly used for traditional A/B tests is not recommended for switchback. experiments:

**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/sequential-testing-on-statsig


**Summary:**  
Sequential testing is a solution to the “peeking problem” in A/B testing, allowing continuous monitoring of experiment results without increasing the False Positive Rate (FPR). We recently revamped Statsig’s Sequential Testing methodology to enable faster decisions. Compared to our previous implementation, this new approach has higher statistical power during the early days of the experiment while enforcing a strict cap on FPR


**Key Points:**

- The need for sequential testing

- Limitations of the underlying statistical test

- Statsig’s sequential testing methodology

- The false positive rate in A/A tests remains below 5% even with repeated measurements over a 4-week period.

**Summary:**  
You don’t experiment for wins
In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:
This FOMO-engendering content has a point. Experimentation is a valuable tool for understanding what kind of changes work for your product; with that knowledge in hand, you can more reliably pick a good future direction. However, in practice—and especially in product experimentation—the real wins come from not losing


**Key Points:**

- In discussions around online experimentation, it’s common for proponents to point to legendary wins that have come out of a/b testing programs:

- Chasing rainbows: The illusion of the big win

- The unpalatable truth is that these victories aren’t common, and are frequently incorrect. There are a number of contributing factors:

- A penny saved is a penny earned

- Product owners use the product differently than the typical user, which skews their intuition and causes them to design unhelpful features

- When your customers forthcomingly celebrate the way you support them, it speaks volumes.

- Have you ever had an issue with your software that you couldn’t figure out on your own? Do you remember why?

- But what’s more common—at least in my case:Sometimes you have a very specific question and need an expert to talk to.

- Well, we at Statsig thinkthis model sucks.

- The best support occurs when the company you’re interfacing with feels like a part of the team, and that’s exactly what Statsig achieves.

**Date:** 2023-04-06T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Palak Goel and Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-products-require-experimentation


**Summary:**  
In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today. Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:
First, product managers would come up with a new idea for a product and lay out a release timeline. Engineers would then spend months or years working on a single version of this new product


**Key Points:**

- In the 1990s, building software looked a lot different than it does today.

- Here’s a rough outline of how it worked:

- How can you launch and iterate on features quickly without compromising your existing user experience?

### 217. Optimizing AI model temperature with Statsig&#39;s Autotune

**Date:** 2023-04-03T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Skye Scofield  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ai-experimentation-model-temperature-autotune


**Summary:**  
When building apps using large language models, developers are presented with an interesting choice: choosing model temperature. This innocuous number can have a massive impact on model performance, as you can see below:
This is obviously exaggerated, but the question remains: How do you choose the right temperature for a given application. A higher temperature invites greater creativity and variance, but risks producing errors—so what’s the right tradeoff


**Key Points:**

- When building apps using large language models, developers are presented with an interesting choice: choosing model temperature.

- This innocuous number can have a massive impact on model performance, as you can see below:

- This is obviously exaggerated, but the question remains: How do you choose the right temperature for a given application?

### 218. Feature flag solutions: Building vs. buying

**Date:** 2023-04-02T00:00-07:00  
**Author:** Ryan Musser  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/build-vs-buy-feature-flags-gates-experiment-platform


**Summary:**  
In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig. I’ve observed some patterns and developed some standard questions that I ask these customers, which I think objectively helps them begin to understand which of the build and/or buy options is right for them. Longer term I plan to create a calculator or survey that can help people understand which option they should prioritize, but in the meantime I want to share


**Key Points:**

- In most of the evaluations I help customers with, they are deciding between building/improving their in-house system or buying Statsig.

- Building an experimentation platform requires specialized engineering, data science and data engineering skills and resources.

- Have your team members built similar systems before?

- What kind of infrastructure and architecture is your team familiar with?

- After surveying your team, if the answer to this question doesn’t inspire confidence,you should consider buying, or a hybrid build and buy.

**Author:** Anu Sharma  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/leading-a-team-of-lions


**Summary:**  
Training your team to make independent decisions
“It was like the debate of a group of savages as to how to extract a screw from a piece of wood. Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed, they were devising methods of applying more force still, of obtaining more efficient pincers, of using levers and fulcrums so that more men could bring their strength to bear


**Key Points:**

- Training your team to make independent decisions

- People who are right a lot, they listen a lot, and people who are right a lot, change their mind a lot.

- People who are right seek to dis-confirm their most profoundly-held convictions, which is very unnatural for humans.

- Jeff Bezos

- I wish more folks shared how they train their teams and operationalize independent decision making. Here’s my short list.

**Author:** Tore Hanssen  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-do-my-facebook-groups-look-different


**Summary:**  
By now, most people realize that when they open Facebook or Instagram on their phone, their experience is very different than the person next to them. It goes deeper than just the content that you see, and the ranking algorithms backings those — the buttons you have to click, the way a post with multiple photos shows up, or even theshade of the bluemight be different. At Statsig, we’ve been working to help any company run these same types of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Trying to experiment on a different unit type than a “user”? Or just miss GK::forID()?Try out customIDs on Statsig.

### 239. Creating a Meme bot for Workplace (by Facebook) Using Statsig

**Date:** 2022-05-31T21:49:16.000Z  
**Author:** Maria McCulley  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/creating-meme-bot-facebook-workplace-using-statsig


**Summary:**  
One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool. The macro tool allowed employees to upload an image or gif, name it, and then use it across many internal surfaces. Within Workplace, all you had to do was type #m followed by the name of your macro and the macro bot would respond to your comment or message with the macro associated with that name


**Key Points:**

- One of my favorite and most used tools at Facebook was the macro tool.

- But why have a dedicated tool instead of sending the image yourself each time? A few main reasons:

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Once a macro is made, anyone at the company can easily use it.

- Create a Custom Integration within Workplace

### 241. Don’t be a Holdout holdout

**Date:** 2022-05-04T21:22:13.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/getting-in-on-holdouts


**Summary:**  
An opinionated guide on using Holdouts
Feature Level Holdouts
Good teams move fast. They’re trying several ideas at any given time. When they find something that works, they ship it and find the next idea to try


**Key Points:**

- An opinionated guide on using Holdouts

- Engineering overhead. For each feature you ship with a holdout, you’re committing to support an if-then-else fork in your code. For a fast moving team, having to support multiple code paths makes the test and debug matrix large. Shorter holdouts help make this manageable. When your legacy code path breaks — if you don’t find and fix it swiftly, your holdout results become untrustworthy.

- Opportunity cost. When you ship features that increase revenue or retention, a large holdout means leaving those gains on the table. There’s also dissatisfaction you cause when someone sees a friend with a shiny new feature that they don’t have.

- Monitoring. Holdouts are typically analyzed in detail only at the end of the holdout period. It’s useful to check in on them at a regular cadence (e.g. monthly) to make sure there isn’t anything unexpected that may taint the holdout. A broken control variant impacting only 1% of your users can make the Holdout useless if you only detect it at the end of the holdout period. There’s little point comparing metrics between users with new features and users with a broken experience. The act of checking the performance of the Holdout group can spawn investigations to understand unexpected movements.

- Users, Customer Support & Marketing.For people in the holdout, it is confusing to see friends get a spiffy new feature, while you don’t. It’s important to retire and create new holdouts every cycle — so it’s not the same set of users punished again and again.

### 242. There’s More To Learn From Tests

**Date:** 2022-04-20T18:45:44.000Z  
**Author:** Craig Sexauer  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/theres-more-to-learn-from-tests


**Summary:**  
Split testing has become an important tool for companies across many industries. There’s a huge amount of literature (and Medium posts. ) dedicated to examples and explanations of why this is, and why large companies in Tech have built their cultures around designing products in a hypothesis-driven way


**Key Points:**

- The Standard: Pre-Launch Experimentation

- It’s common that when people think about testing, they mostly think about pre-launch experimentation:

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- A user need is surfaced or hypothesized

- An MVP of the solution is designed

**Summary:**  
Experiment Review Best Practices
A surprise win. When building out instant games on Facebook a few years back, a new developer switched to use a newer version of an internal SDK. The switch was motivated by keeping the code base supportable and it was expected to have no impact on users

**Summary:**  
The tools that make our jobs possible
When my co-workerSami Springmanand I joined Statsig, we both came from Snowflake- a mature sales organization with every bizdev tool you could dream of. As the first sales people at Statsig, we’ve been building our biztech stack from zero. After some trial and error, we have a list of 4 tools wecan’t live without


**Key Points:**

- The tools that make our jobs possible

- To be totally candid, without Sales Navigator, my job would benext-to-impossible.

- Most of the outbound business we source is either directly through LinkedIn, or from Zoominfo phone numbers/ emails.

- The only caveat for Outreach- the tool is less useful for account execs who aren’t making many cold calls + bulk emails.

- For younger orgs without published contact info, Seamless has been very helpful.

### 250. Reading Experimentation Tea Leaves

**Date:** 2022-03-09T02:11:15.000Z  
**Author:** Vineeth Madhusudanan  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/reading-experimentation-tea-leaves


**Summary:**  
Making experiment readouts trustworthy
As we talk to many customers, one thing is clear: many common beliefs for product experimentation are plain wrong. These are often theoretical, academic and outdated. They lead teams to believe in a false sense of precision and waste months waiting on a handful of experiments


**Key Points:**

- Making experiment readouts trustworthy

- With great power though comes great responsibility

- You can also useholdouts and backteststo measure the cumulative impact of features over a longer period of time.

- A few tips to make sure you’re not reacting to noise -

- Have a hypothesis on the change you’re making (and expected impact). If you’re rolling out a bug fix to the video player in the Facebook app and see a small reduction in new user signups, it’s unlikely your bug fix is causing that. But if you are seeing an increase in video watch time, then you can usually be sure your fix is working as intended. Many practitioners apply a 95% confidence interval to metrics they’re expecting impact on, and use a 99% confidence interval on other metrics.

**Summary:**  
More than Blue Button vs Green Button: How we use Statsig
Statsig is a feature flagging and experimentation platform, and the most frequent response to this is “what do you mean by experimentation platform. ” The easiest way to explain it: Statsig helps you run A/B tests to optimize your product.

### 252. Failing fast, or How I learned to kiss a lot of frogs

**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/failing-fast-kiss-a-lot-of-frogs


**Summary:**  
Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast. In a startup, everybody builds stuff (code, websites, sales lists, etc) — and part of the building process is accepting that not everything you make is good. But, switching from outcome to learning-oriented can speed up productivity, and make it easier to identify good ideas


**Key Points:**

- Hands down, the most important thing I’m learning at Statsig is how to fail fast.

- But, this is when I learned the value of minimum viable products (MVPs).

Every feature is well intentioned but…
Every feature is well-intentioned… that’s why we build them. However, our experience is less than a third create positive impact. Another third of the features require iteration before they land the desired impact — users might not discover it or are confused by it


**Key Points:**

- Every feature is well intentioned but…

- Tavouris an app that helps fill your fridge with unique, craft beers you can’t find locally. They use Statsig to manage features and run experiments.

- Tavour decided to tweak the feature to let users see more auto complete suggestions without having to scroll.

- The revised feature increased new user activation rate, giving them the confidence to finish rolling out this feature!

**Author:** Ritvik Mishra  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/experimentation-driven-development


**Summary:**  
I worked on Facebook News Feed before I joined Statsig, and that’s where I learned about the value of experimentation. The culture in News Feed wasn’t just to use experiments to verify that our intuitions about what changes may lead to improvements were true. We also used experiments much like any good scientist would to understand more about their field—we started with a question, formed a hypothesis, and then went about constructing an experiment that would allow us to test our hypothesis and 


**Key Points:**

- I worked on Facebook News Feed before I joined Statsig, and that’s where I learned about the value of experimentation.

- Here’s an example of this method in action.

**Summary:**  
In the summer of 2021, HBO accidentally sent an email to millions of past and current subscribers with the body “This message is used by integration tests only”. The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments. For continuous deployment, teams often create environments for development, staging and production


**Key Points:**

- The internet was gracious about the mistake an intern made (context), but it was an interesting reminder of the challenges of managing environments.

- Two philosophies : Per Environment Config vs Global Config

- Some advantages of the Global Config approach (with environment specific exceptions) include…

- This is useful in production where stability is paramount, but can slow down iteration in development and staging environments.

**Summary:**  
Challenging prevailing narratives
You’re tasked with deciding where to go for dinner with your friends. You whip out your phone, fire up Yelp, and scroll through nearby restaurants. Piling on some filters, you settle on an option that looks good

**Summary:**  
How integrating data sources led a manufacturer to more consistent chicken size and larger profits
Integrating data sources is, in my humble opinion, one of the most under-utilized tools in a tech stack. Let me explain why… with chickens. One of the companies I used to work with when I was in the data warehousing field was a large chicken processing company


**Key Points:**

- How integrating data sources led a manufacturer to more consistent chicken size and larger profits

- Integrating data sources is, in my humble opinion, one of the most under-utilized tools in a tech stack. Let me explain why… with chickens.

- Data integration for bigger chickens

**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/statsig-design-sdks-different-application-environments


**Summary:**  
At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence. An important part of this is to make sure our SDKs not only provide the necessary APIs, but also do it in a way that works seamlessly with the environments their applications are in. Specifically, we design any SDK for either client-side or server-side applications


**Key Points:**

- At Statsig, we want to enable our customers to ship and test new features faster, and with confidence.

### 268. Sales development hacks

**Date:** 2021-10-20T02:14:39.000Z  
**Author:** Emma Dahl  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/ales-development-hacks


**Summary:**  
Sales is all about process. I came to Statsig (17 employees) from Snowflake (2,500 employees), and while the product I work with has changed, my process hasn’t. I’ve found the key to success with pipeline generation is to iterate on the same process to make improvements as necessary, without reinventing the wheel


**Key Points:**

- Nail your pitch

- I pitch to my mom. If she doesn’t understand it, I still have work to do.

- For example, “Statsig helps customers build better products faster by running 10x more experiments”

- Don’t reinvent the wheel

- Spend the 10 minutes to build out a great email, save it, andmake sure you never write that email again.

### 269. User-Level vs. Device-Level Experiments with Statsig

**Date:** 2021-10-15T03:47:36.000Z  
**Author:** Maggie Stewart  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/user-level-vs-device-level-experiments


**Summary:**  
A common challenge in A/B testing arises when we want to track customers from logged-out to logged-in states. Consider, for example, testing a new variant of the account creation flow. This begins with logged-out customers, but we also want to monitor key metrics and events once they complete the flow and log in


**Key Points:**

- Comparing key metrics across test and control groups requires joining 2 different sets of logs: Exposures and events.

- Exposures:Every time we run a check to determine which experience is delivered to a user (e.g.: test or control), we create a log containing:

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Unit ID: The unique identifier used for random group assignment

- Group: The experiment group they were placed in

### 294. My Five Favorite Things About Swift

**Date:** 2021-05-11T07:20:26.000Z  
**Author:** Jiakan Wang  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/my-five-favorite-things-about-swift


**Summary:**  
Statsigstrives to empower all developers to ship features faster, so naturally one of the first milestones for us was to provide an SDK for iOS development. I started doing iOS development at Facebook, which only used Objective-C for its iOS apps. But given Swift’s growing popularity (Apple’s own adoption has been growing quickly), we decided to offer and write our SDK natively in Swift


**Key Points:**

- Swift is much more readable

- NSString *firstMsg = @”Concatenating strings in Objective-C “;

- NSString *secondMsg = @”is hard”;

- NSString *fullMsg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@”%@%@”, firstMsg, secondMsg];

- Swift supports modern language features

**Summary:**  
RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust
RUIDs (Rodrigo’s Unique Identifiers) are 64 bit ids mathematically guaranteed to be unique when generated within the sameRUID root. Check it out on GitHub. AnRUID rootis a set of RUID generators where each generator can be uniquely identified through shared configuration


**Key Points:**

- RUID — Time-Travel-Safe, Distributed, Unique, 64 bit ids generated in Rust

- The canonical version of RUIDs (this repo) uses 41 bits for timestamp, 14 bits for a monotonically increasing sequence, and 9 bits for the root id.

- bits is enough to cover Rodrigo’s projected lifespan in milliseconds.

- bits is about the # of RUIDs that can be generated single threaded in Rodrigo’s personal computer (~20M ids per second).

- bits is what remains after the calculations above, and is used for root id. The root id is further split into 5 bits for a cluster id, and 4 bits for a node id.

**Summary:**  
Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups
As companies become more comfortable with running AB tests, they often consider simultaneously testing more than one variation. It’s called a multi-arm experiment, also known as multi-group and A/B/n (ABn) testing (but should not be confused withmulti-armed bandit experiments, hopefully the topic of a later blog post). Multi-arm testing involves two or more test groups (eg


**Key Points:**

- Dealing with Significance (⍺) for Multiple Test Groups

- Significance is Much More Significant

- Solution #1: Apply a Bonferroni correction

- The Bonferroni correction is risk-adverse solution that errs on avoiding Type I errors at the expense of Type II errors.

**Author:** Vijaye Raji  
**URL:** https://statsig.com/blog/why-we-started-statsig


**Summary:**  
When I joined Facebook, one of the things that surprised me was the autonomy Engineers had in building new products and features, and how this enabled them to move really fast. I was curious how decisions were made around product features, since based on my previous experience, the bulk of the time sink happened inside conference rooms — where experienced engineers and PMs debated the details, made decisions, and wrote design docs, all before the first line of code was even written. Product deve


**Key Points:**

- Product development at Facebook often started with the germ of an idea which was quickly translated into code.

- If people wrote code right away, how did they make sure they were building features users actually wanted?

- Gatekeeper:Allows developers to build features visible only to a targeted set of users. For example, these could bedogfoodersand testers until a feature is ready for public consumption. Engineers will then open it up to a small user base to validate everything is working well before launching to the world.

- And the biggest peace-of-mind comes from knowing that when something goes really wrong at any point,you can easily turn features off in real-time.

- Quick Experiments (A/B):This tool takes the debates out of conference rooms and puts hypotheses to test in production. Instead of endless discussions about the “perfect” design, the amount of flexibility to provide, the corner cases to cover, engineers quickly code up different variants and put them out in front of users. How users interact with the product gives rich insights into what works and what doesn’t.
